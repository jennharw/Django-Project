Jeffrey Holliday	The goal of this paper was to document how native (L1) speakers of a language with a two-way stop contrast acquire a three-way stop contrast in a second language (L2). Mandarin presents a two-way stop contrast cued primarily by VOT, whereas Korean presents a three-way stop contrast cued jointly by VOT and the ID of the following vowel. Mandarin and Korean stop productions from 12 L1 Mandarin novice L2 learners of Korean were subjected to acoustic analysis. Results revealed a wide variety of production patterns, suggesting that the learning of an L2 contrast may not always be predicted by cross-language acoustic correspondences. Six of the participants were recorded again both six and 12 months later. The longitudinal results showed that some learners were unable to produce the Korean contrast in a native-like way even after one year of intensive L2 instruction. Learners whose initial production strategy was consistent but incorrect fared worse after one year than learners whose productions initially exhibited more variability. These results contribute to our understanding of both the L2 acquisition of "new" and "similar" categories and also how well naive perceptual assimilation can predict L2 production.

Jeffrey Holliday	This article presents K-SPAN (Korean Surface Phonetics and Neighborhoods), a database of surface phonetic forms and several measures of phonological neighborhood density for 63,836 Korean words. Currently publicly available Korean corpora are limited by the fact that they only provide orthographic representations in Hangeul, which is problematic since phonetic forms in Korean cannot be reliably predicted from orthographic forms. We describe the method used to derive the surface phonetic forms from a publicly available orthographic corpus of Korean, and report on several statistics calculated using this database; namely, segment unigram frequencies, which are compared to previously reported results, along with segment-based and syllable-based neighborhood density statistics for three types of representation: an "orthographic" form, which is a quasi-phonological representation, a "conservative" form, which maintains all known contrasts, and a "modern" form, which represents the pronunciation of contemporary Seoul Korean. These representations are rendered in an ASCII-encoded scheme, which allows users to query the corpus without having to read Korean orthography, and permits the calculation of a wide range of phonological measures.
Jeffrey Holliday	Purpose: Four measures of children's developing robustness of phonological contrast were compared to see how they correlated with age, vocabulary size, and adult listeners' correctness ratings. Method: Word-initial sibilant fricative productions from eighty-one 2- to 5-year-old children and 20 adults were phonetically transcribed and acoustically analyzed. Four measures of robustness of contrast were calculated for each speaker on the basis of the centroid frequency measured from each fricative token. Productions that were transcribed as correct from different children were then used as stimuli in a perception experiment in which adult listeners rated the goodness of each production. Results: Results showed that the degree of category overlap, quantified as the percentage of a child's productions whose category could be correctly predicted from the output of a mixed-effects logistic regression model, was the measure that correlated best with listeners' goodness judgments. Conclusions: Even when children's productions have been transcribed as correct, adult listeners are sensitive to within-category variation quantified by the child's degree of category overlap. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between the age of a child and adults' sensitivity to different types of within-category variation in children's speech.
Jeffrey Holliday	Background/Aims: Many studies have shown that experienced second language (L2) learners are more skilled than novice L2 learners at a variety of L2 tasks, including auditory discrimination between members of L2 phonological contrasts. In this paper we argued that while L2 experience is typically beneficial when comparing the effects of more versus less experience, it is not necessarily beneficial when comparing the effects of some experience versus none. Methods: We compared the perceptual assimilation and discrimination of the Korean sibilant fricatives /s(h)/ and /s*/ by 3 native Mandarin populations: naive listeners, novice L2 learners (4-6 weeks of experience), and advanced L2 learners (over 2 years of experience). Results: The perceptual assimilation of /s(h)/ changed as a result of L2 experience, but only in the /a/ context. It is also shown that novice L2 learners were less accurate than the naive listeners at discriminating between /s(h)/ and /s*/ but, crucially, only in the /a/ context. Conclusion: The perception of /s(h)/ by L2 learners may be affected by knowledge of the L2 unavailable to naive listeners, and some aspects of this knowledge may result in a decline in discrimination accuracy after even a very short period of L2 experience.

Jeffrey Holliday	Previous studies have shown that non-native speakers of Korean not only have difficulty producing the word-initial three-way stop contrast, but also exhibit a wide range of production patterns. Because these studies have only investigated native (L1) speakers of English and Mandarin and given the overall paucity of research on non-native Korean, it is not yet clear how dependent these findings are on the particular native language under investigation. The current paper reinforces our empirical grounding via extension to L1 speakers of Japanese. It is shown that although naive Japanese listeners consistently perceive Korean fortis stops as voiced, and Korean lenis and aspirated stops as voiceless, novice second language learners do not produce any significant difference among the three stop categories, despite producing clear differences between their native Japanese stop categories. Unlike in previous studies of L1 speakers of English and Mandarin, there was very little inter-speaker variation, and all speakers produced all Korean stops with long lag voice onset time.
Jeffrey Holliday	The current study reports the results of a perception experiment in which 20 naive native Mandarin listeners classified and rated the goodness of Korean stops /p, t, k, p(h), t(h), k(h), p*, t*, k*/, affricates /t(sic), t(sic)*, t(sic)(h)/, and fricatives /s(h), s*/ in terms of Mandarin segmental categories. It was found that listeners were sensitive to the voice onset time dimension of Korean stops and the presence of aspiration in Korean affricates, but Korean lenis and aspirated obstruents were generally assimilated to a single Mandarin category because the f0 cue differentiating them is not relevant to any Mandarin segmental contrast. The affricates were perceived as alveolopalatal and postalveolar more often than alveolar. The perception of fricatives was strongly influenced by vowel context, as the two fricatives were often perceived as different categories before /a/, but as the same category more often before /i/ and /u/. The results for the affricates and fricatives may be partly explained by Mandarin phonotactic constraints that prohibit alveolar and postalveolar consonants before /i/ and alveolopalatal consonants before /a/ or /u/.

강헌국	Yi-Kwangsu designs the theory that makes the concept of love be subjected tothe concept of enlightment in Mujung and his early essays. But love which is aprivate emotion cannot harmony with enlightment. Enlightment is a public obligation.Those two are easy to conflict each other. Such a conflict is observed after Mujung.In order to show what kind of change has been happened in the relation betweenlove and enlightment after Mujung, Gaechukja and Jaesaeng are discussed in thisthesis. In Gaechukja love treads on the road of farewell from enlightment. Loveconfirms that it is not a tool of enlightment but a purely private emotion. The stepsof love since it parted from enlightment, can be traced in Jaesaeng. With partingfrom enligntment love becomes free from enlightment’s moral control. So love isdefenselessly exposed to the seduction of money and sex. The social trend ofmamonism distorts love to an item which can be dealed with money. But love searchesfor a new value in the middle of such seduction. Love for mankind is the newvalue which the hero of Jaesaeng has been arrived from a long and deep meditation.As a result of that meditation, love breaks away a private emotion, and sublimateitself an idea. Ideal love is so sublime that it can contain enlightment. The relationbetween love and enlightment is reversed to that of Mujung.
강헌국	This study takes note of the conflict between Kim Dong-in’s methodology and his writing which is discovered in The Sadness of a Frailty (약한 자의 슬픔) and Hey, a Thin Heart (마음이 옅은 자여). To understand the cause of the conflict, I investigate the structure of his creation methodology. And then I trace the alteration made in his methodology with the relation of his 1920’s short stories.Kim Doing-in’s creation methodology which is used in The Sadness and Hey, , is composed with three kinds. They are the skill of manipulating puppets, internal focalization, and confession style. I find, the confession style makes trouble with other two kinds. The correctness of my discovery is verified with the fact that he dose not use it any more after The Sadness and Hey, .Aborting the confession style, Kim Dong-in chooses another method. It is the multi-layers structure. He thinks, layering narrative levels may frame a world independent from real world and protect the contents of that independent world from the inquisition of reality. With the help of multi-layers structure, the skill of manipulating puppets could be used freely in the view of him. A Song of Sailing (배따라기) and A Sonata of Crazy Fire are successful cases which he makes with the use of multi-layers structure. But The multi-layers structure does not always make such a good result.Except using multi-layers structure, Kim Dong-in’s writing have to face with real world. There is not a barrier to cut the inquisition of reality. In the point of view of Realism, the reality of novel is achieved by representing real world. But he always believes that reality can be created by artistic skill. His creation of reality sometimes meets to the reality of outside world by chance. Lashing (태형) and Potato (감자) are such happy cases. The success of the two text again confirms that Realism is the essence of novel.
강헌국	Kim Yoo-jung proceeds his writing in the state that he accepts money as an undeniable condition of life. So the concern for money can be found from all of his novellas. The catch of that feature makes me project this thesis. I investigate how money is expressed in his texts, and then I discuss the narrative function and effect of money in his texts. Money is showed by way of ‘correctly declared value’, ‘calculation’, and ‘deal’. Those three expression modes of money are related to the modern capitalism in which money becomes the governing value over the reality. The position of money in his texts does not end there. Money is actively included in the process of creating narrative discourse. The arrangement of characters is centered on money. The narrative started from deficiency of money, goes through of questing money, and aims at taking money. Prostitution, gamble, and gold-rush are the choices in the course of the questing money. Those choices go against the spirit of the modern capitalism because they are irrational. Therefore he can be said to have double attitude to the modern capitalism. On the one hand, he describes vividly the modern capitalism with the phenomena of money. But on the other hand, he deviates from the spirit of the modern capitalism taking irrational process of questing money. Such a double attitude of him is originated from the Japanese colonial system. Making profit and accumulating wealth in rational way are impossible under that system. Money is the clue to help him to understand correctly Japanese colonial system, and it is also a chance of hope for him. In the state that he accepts money as an undeniable condition of life, the only way he can seek is to use money in humane way.As he can not renounce the hope to the end, he wants to find hunan face in money.
강헌국	Humanity has not received much attention by the researchers whowere interested in Yi Kwangsu’s thought and literature. Humanityappears in Jaesaeng for the first time in the developing process of YiKwangsu’s novel. The existing studies understood that concept as anone-time phenomenon or another face of enlightenment. But I getdifferent position to those existing studies and regard the humanity inJaesaeng as the climax at which Yi Kwangsu arrives. The thought ofYi Kwangsu which has progressed in upward direction surpassesnationality and flies to the level of mankind through Jaesaeng. Thehumanity of Yi Kwangsu may not be explained with enlightenmentbecause the concept of mankind is different from that of nationality.The composition of thought which crowns humanity, could havesome difficulty to process love as a private emotion. It is seemed thatYujeong and Sarang are the products of the trouble which Yi Kwangsuhas underwent to arrange the position of love to humanity. In Yujeong,the problem of desire which can be motive power of love, isexhaustively considered. The avenue to humanity is sought with thatconsideration. But Yi Kwangsu just confirms the violent reality ofdesire instead of finding that avenue. The experience in the creation ofYujeong has an effect Yi Kwangsu in the writing of Sarang, so heaccepts humanity as an axiom. He does not try to arrange the relationbetween love and humanity any more. The narrative of Sarang isstructured like a process of demonstration which shows the meaningand value of humanity, and the problem of desire is concealed oravoided in the course of that narrative.The demonstration which is made in Sarang, dose not aim at thesalvation of mankind. It just confirms the superiority and sanctity ofthe disciples who serve the ideology of humanity. And the intention ofthe disciples who despise and banish those humble and inferior beings,secretly hides behind the demonstration. Therefore the humanity canbe connected with the survival of the fittest of imperialism. Is theavenue to the pro-Japanese made by such a process in Yi Kwangsu’sliterature?
강헌국	The proposition of this study is that An essay of nation reformation(「민족개조론」, from now on, this essay will be called as an abbreviation form like this, An essay ) is related to Soil(「흙」) as a project to a practice. From that proposition, this study examined the realizability of An essay, and then the result of that examination is compared to Soil’s narrative part of enlightenment.The main three proposals in An essay which are required for nation reformation, are a long time, a pan-nation organization, and non-political stance. But those proposals paradoxically confirm only the impossibility of nation reformation under Japanese colony. Those proposal could be realized, if all condition is amicable. But Japanese colonial government wouldn’t like to give such a condition.It is seemed that Lee Kwang-su wrote Soil with intend to examine the possibility of nation reformation in the situation of novel. Soil reconstructs the reality of Japanese colonial age as a battlefield of self-interests, and it is hard to make nation reformation in such a situation. Huh Sung who is embodied as a saint in Soil is a maximum and limit level to stand against to the negative reality. But Huh Sung as a saint is helpless in front of the evil in reality, because Japanese colonial rule lurks behind such evil. Soil also confirm the impossibility of nation reformation suggested in An Essay.
강헌국	In his ‘early trilogy’, Yeom sang-sup practiced confession style by expressing the subjective feelings of the textual self. However, his novel attention has shifted towards objectivity since Manseijeon. In the preceding study, the changes between the early trilogy and Manseijeon were defined as either a break or a fault. This paper noted the point and discussed that the change realized the potentialities that were implicit in his early trilogy.Yeom Sang-sup’s realistic writing style which was made after his early trilogy sought objectivity across facts and meanings. Facts were faithfully reproduced and meaning was logically developed. Between fact and meaning, the former was valued. It was his tenacious attitude as a realist that no faith or value takes precedence over facts.Manipulation or transformation of facts for some purpose was not acceptable to him. Although the meaning formed by a narrative description was universal in itself, in most cases, it was relativized in the reality of text. In his view, the objective reality was cold-hearted and harsh, to the extent that it was impossible to realize universal value or ethics.Yeom Sang-seop tried to humble himself before the fact enough to retain the essential value. He was unable to stick to a particular position politically because he wanted to faithfully reproduce the multifaceted and multi-layered reality. That is why his political position is not clearly defined.
강헌국	Hwang Soon-won started his literary career as a poet. He had run twenty two poems on literary journals and issued two collections of poems before publishing his first short story. His career as a poet has been taken importantly by the researches which studied his short stories. As a result of such an interest, many papers have insisted that lyricism is an individual characteristic of his short stories. But lyrical character is not appropriated by his short stories. Short story as a genre generally contains lyricism. So those papers made a mistake that took a general matter as a special. I project this paper from critical review to those papers. And I propose ‘magical transcendence’ and ‘pictorial narrative’ as two characteristics of his short stories.The magical effect of folktale functions as an main structural element in his short stories. In the case of any folktale not to be cited, the magical effect as an episode or a constituting principle, serves to narrative. some characters in his short stories, regard a real experience as a magical phenomenon, try to transcend torment of real life with the help of magic. In some cases, the narrative of his text are plotted according to the process of magical rite. Magical transcendence is the name which this paper use to call such phenomena. The technique which substitutes impressive scene for narration, is frequently used in his short stories. I I call pictorial narrative the phenomenon that narrative process converges to such a scene.Lyricism is difficult to be used in an objective copy to reality, because it tends to head for subject. Hwang Soon-won’s short stories are no exception for this problem of realism. He copies not objective reality but the characters’ subjective attitude to the reality. The attitude goes from humanitarianism and endurance to nihilism.
강헌국	This paper examined the reasons why Kim Dong-in chose to write historical novels in the 1930s in the internal development of his creative methodology. The preceding studies indicated his poverty as the reason and then stopped further discussion. This paper argues that besides such an extrinsic reason, there had already been an movement toward historical novel in his creative methodology. His creative methodology, which is commonly referred to as the skill of manipulating puppets, got the framed structure in the course of his 1920s short stories. The function of testimony which the external story of framed structure has, has an effect to confirm the reality of the internal story. He judged that he could freely use the skill of manipulating puppets in internal story with the help of the external story’s testimony. However, the overconfidence and abuse of the framed structure also led to negative consequences which destructed the reality of the work.When the framed structure caused no small problems in Kim Dong-in’s writing, historical novel emerged as a new horizon for the skill of manipulating puppets. For him, the historical novel was understood from the point of the framed structure. He believed that if history, which exists with public records and official knowledge, functions as a witness in a external story, he could be guaranteed to get reality no matter what story he told in historical novel as the internal story. Of course, the minimum provision for proof that it did not damage history had to be complied with. He tried to realize his ‘True Art(참예술)’ which considered creation to be the greatest virtue, in historical novel by freely practicing the skill of manipulating puppets. In The Youngers(젊은 그들) he used history as an excuse, and in The Spring of Unhyeon Palace(운현궁의 봄) and The Great Sooyang(대수양) he claimed his own subjective recognition of history. However, it is confirmed from the preceding studies that Kim Dong-in's historical novels did not achieve the results he expected in the first place. It was hard to get positive reviews for a historical novel that went out of history. The historical novels by Kim Dong-in, who started from history, is aimed at refusing to be contained in history. Creative aspirations have led his historical novel out of history.
권보드래	The March 1st Movement has been interpreted from nationalist viewpoint. This essay is an attempt to read the Movement as an explosion of a variety of discontents and yearnings. From an issues of taxation and compulsory labor to inequality problems for education and employment, a range and content of discontents was diverse. The masses in the March 1st Movement exclaimed “Mansei”[Long live, Hurray] and grasped flags in their hands, but what did “Mansei” mean and what did flags represent? I researched many cases of uprising across regions and classes, then I found out that taegukgi, a national flag of old Daehan empire was limited and replaced although it governed the people as a representative flag, and that “Mansei” was not only an abbreviation of “Masei of a national independence”, but also an explosion of an intimidated self and community toward the world. The March 1st Movement resonated idealism after the World War Ⅰ, and moreover, the people of the Movement demanded a right to participate the global discussion about “what the world should be” and asked the world a march for the reformation. The March 1st Movement marked a utopian moment where a self, community, nation, and the world integrated for a better world with prophetic enthusiasm.
권보드래	This paper is a suggestion to read Choi In-hoon's The Square as a P.O.W. narrative. P.O.W., Prisoner of War of Korean war has drawn a lot of attention these days, since the cold war regime is facing the end even on Korean peninsula, and the cold war archives have opened to researchers in the age of openness. Literature of P.O.W., covering a range from memoirs of former P.O.W. themselves to the 21st century novels, have been collected and studied under such a new light. The Square, a product of April Uprising in 1960, casts a P.O.W. hero who experienced both South and North Korea but chose to go to a neutral country at the end. Such a denial or evasion from a forced alternative between the divided native lands impressed a lot of contemporaries, and an idea of neutrality, though the meaning of neutrality is restricted to neutrality in Korean War, moved many young intellectuals.The narrative of The Square is based on the reality of seventy six P.O.W.s who prefer neutral countries over two Koreas. Such a preference became possible when a new principle for war and P.O.W. on human rights presupposition was suggested. The core of new principle was voluntary repatriation policy, which contrasted with forcible repatriation that Geneva Convention of 1949 prescribed, and it signaled a new stage of ideological competition on war and peace. A variety of P.O.W. narratives can be read as a variety of responses to make respective definition of war, peace, and P.O.W. against those new circumstances.The peculiarity of The Square comes from the fact that it refuses naive realism for Korean War and P.O.W. It actively responses to new concepts of war and peace and ventures to find an exit from division system of Korea; nevertheless, it challenges to the division system by placing the cruel reality of Korean War aside. Yi Myung-joon, the hero of The Square, rarely tells his own war experience, instead he covers up Korean War actualities with his reflection and abstraction. The writer Choi In-hoon managed to change a direction of Korean literature to face grand issues such as universe, world, nation, and history by taking a strategy of suppressing firsthand memories. It is why The Square is so distinct in comparison with other Korean War or P.O.W. literature, and how The Square could endure days of developmental dictatorship as a text of neutrality.
권보드래	The March 1st Movement, although it had not been explored thoroughly during the colonial period, was a hidden focus of literary testimonies and symptoms. The main actors on the early stage of modern Korean literature, who were born around 1900, participated in and influenced by the Movement, and it entailed the life-long traces. The March 1st Movement, which spreaded widely by a rumor of impending or even realized independence, was a calling and requirement of reformation on the national and global scale, but ended with violence, imprisonment, and death. Therefore, how to memorize and interpret the experience of Movement was a pivotal issue in shaping the lives afterwards. Yi Kwangsu exemplified a path of negation and restart in that scandalous "Reformation of the Nation" and a novel Regeneration, while Kim Dongin buried the Movement as a non-existent event, and Shim Hun suggested the March 1st Movement as a learning curve to socialism. Yeom Sangseop posited himself on a peculiar position, which questioned the Movement and placed it as an endless source of inquiries.
권보드래	Kim U-chin, a playwright of the 1920s who had passed away before arrivinga glory as a literati, was a son of a new technocrat of the last days in Chos ndynasty, Kim S ng-kyu. Both of them, failing to acquiring statuses of real representativefigures of their days until now, still remain as the problematic individuals whoincarnate their contemporary times through their unique worldviews and experiencesrespectively. Their relationship is particularly interesting. Kim S ng-kyu as a secondaryson of wealthy renowned family, made his way into the world by adapting himselfto changing world through modern knowledge and technologies. He also receivedideologies of patriotism and ‘wealthy nation, strong army’ doctrine, but orientedhimself toward the family value alone after Chos n's annexation to Japan in 1910.His competence as a technology-oriented official and his devotion to the familyrecognition produced a typical yet still unique amalgam, which was forced uponhis descendents. Kim U-chin, the eldest son of Kim S ng-kyu, understood his fatherbut struggled to go beyond father's influence and create his own world. This sceneis even more problematic when it was overlapped with the collective experiencearound the March 1st Movement. Kim Uchin's way in a setting of generationalconflict, which could be named as ‘overcoming’ instead of simple ‘negation’, however,ended in his untimely death.
권보드래	This article is to survey the traces of Danish critic Georg Brandes in the 1910s Korea. Brandes was a devoted intellectual to circulate national cultures and to encourage a progress of freedom and culture in European world. He introduced Scandinavian philosophers and writers such as S. Kierkegaard, H. Ibsen, A. Strindberg to other parts of Europe, and reinvented F. Nietzche to be accepted to the reading public, and made Russian and Polish literature be respected and understood. At the same time, he challenged to the old idealism and conservatism of Scandinavian countries, and led ‘Modern breakthrough’ in Northern Europe. His representative works, Main Currents of Nineteenth Century, Impressions of Russia, Poland: A Study of the Land, People, and Literature, were translated into Japanese in the 1910s, and deeply influenced on young Japanese intellectuals who later worked as cultural mediators of the West to Korea. Nakajawa Rinsen in Japan and Lu Xun in China exemplified Brandes’ arrival to East Asia, and Korean intellectuals participated in such a field of cultural exchange as readers or coproducers.
권보드래	It was in the late 1950s when Lin Yutang acquired a reputation in Korea. The beginning was The Importance of Living. This book, which was originally published in English in the year of 1937, enjoyed a real popularity and acquired a wide readership among Koreans in the 1960s. It was a belated popularity. Lin Yutang's stance was of such a determined liberalist during the wartime that Koreans under Japanese rule hardly had an opportunity to encounter his writings, and after Liberation, Koreans’ preferred liberalist position was not Lin Yutang’s but Edgar Snow’s, who suggested that Chinese communist party was based on radical democracy rather than Marx-Leninist orthodox communism.Lin Yutang, the best known Chinese intellectual among Westerners from the 1930s through the 1950s, had never inclined to communist ideal for his whole life. He understood communism, whether its origin was Western or non-Western, to be identified with totalitarianism, and he did not allow a thinking that overwhelmed the intellectual world during World War Ⅱ of equation and solidarity was necessary as well as possible for democracy and communism. He defends the value of living itself in Importance of Living against ideological pursuit, and suggested freedom and pleasure as the supreme values. It is to be said that such emphasis on freedom and happiness as anti-communist strategy made Lin Yutang popular in Korea, but at the same time, is also to be said that there lied an ironical and secret interests for communist China behind his popularity.
김기형	Ppaengpa-jeon is a modern recreated piece of popular art which is based on the classic, still performing consistently and vigorously. It has been supported by the general public and performed with different kinds of genre such as chang-geuk, yeoseong-gukgeuk, madang-nori, madang-geuk and so on.By the impromptu line, dance and scintillating song, Ppaengpa-jeon receives fervent response from the public. It has performed more than 120 times from 1987 to 2011. Ppaengpa-jeon also has many kinds of main agents and performance spaces. Including the master singer of pansori, actors of traveling theater and madang-nori work on positive lines as main agents of performance. One of them who is good at humorous motion and dramatic expression usually takes the role as ppaengpa. Not only an indoor theater but also the space of festival, national holiday and function are used as the performance space.Ppaengpa-jeon casts the serious consideration on the questions how much traditional art -including recreated piece of art- has the meaning and value in the modern time and space. If traditional art relies on the preservation with the protection of institutional strategy and settles for present, it would lose its footing. Ppaengpa-jeon was able to be the independent piece of art because it kept its life by interaction with the public. Ppaengpa-jeon which is based on the pansori simcheong-ga passed through the specific way of performance named tomakgeuk, and finally it became one of the indoor theater repertories since the gonggansarang performance in 1987.Ppaengpa-jeon is a popular art itself because it consists of familiar narrative with public. For it touches the secular desire of public inner side directly by a vein of humor, it could become very famous. Ppaengpa-jeon shows human nature plainly which is distorted by power of capital.
김기형	The purpose of this article is examining the current existence of performancescripts of the National Changguk Company of Korea and inquiring into themeaningful activity of it. It is important that scripts contain not only lines ofactors, but also the composition of music, motions of actors, and the roles ofcharacters. Also, it sometimes includes the significant reason that it can be playedon the stage and some other meaningful informations about the performance.When the author rewrites the five pansori episodes to changguk scripts, he(orshe) has both autonomy and restriction because it basically has original scripts.He(or she) maintains deoneum or nun-daemok of pansori as much as possibleand tries to adapt it for changguk scripts. The author sometimes puts some partsof music components or songs from other style of pansori as necessary sincehe(or she) writes down the scripts by focusing on the music part that has outstandingmusicality or develops a dramatic scene. We can find that the author acceptsthe new part of music from the previous short play or changguk performances.It depends only on the author.The committee for establishing gukguk[國劇定立委員會] launched in 1968seemed an extension institute of the committee for establishing original text[原典定立委員會]. The purpose of the committee for establishing gukgeuk was buildingup the basic form and tradition of gukguk, and for it, establishing style and scriptsof gukguk which should be requested. Since the committee for establishing gukgukfocused on making ‘canon’, diversity of version of pansori was not considered.When we look on the canon of script that the committee for establishing gukgukmade, there are some features: First, it was based on the version of Shin Jae-hyo.Second, it was textured by deoneum or nun-daemok of pansori. Lastly, witticismpart of pansori was not accepted.For Lee Jin-sun, who belonged to the committee for establishing gukgeuk,changguk was able to be established by accepting the different kinds of dramatictechniques from other traditional performances. For example, he specially paidattention to tal-chum[Korean mask dance], and applied the walking skills of itto the play of changguk.Heo Gyu, who made wanpan changguk, tried to maximize the music part ofthe five pansori and used dochang. He thought traditional theatricals could broadenthe dramatic expression realm of changguk. Also, he concerned not thecontemporary issue but the nature of human being like identity, emotion, andjest nature as Korean.The performance Chunhyang-jeon(1998) and Simcheong-ga(1999) as wanpanjanggeuk changguk originated in wanpan changguk of Heo Gyu. Kim Myeong-gonwas in charge, and it tried to reveal the whole possibilities of music sourcesof pansori like wanpan changguk. However, wanpan janggeuk changguk aimedat big stage, splendid stage setting, and show variety which is not requestedto wanpan changguk.From 2000, the typical feature of phenomenon was found. The actors likePark Seong-hwan and Cho Yeong-gyu started to write the scripts of changguk.For Park Seong-hwan, it was important to make changguk as an universal musicalplay. He emphasized the sophisticated composition and other elements to maximizethe visual effect.The script is one of components in performance art. It is not fixed becausemany people like art directors, actors, composers are related and make influenceon it. From the preparation to the end of stage, scripts are consistently changed,evaluated and revised. On this progress, the author primarily takes an importantrole.
김기형	Study on simbang, or shaman, is also about study on the transmission of shamanism, which holds significance in itself. Research into the genealogy and the hereditary transmission of simbang as well as in－depth study on the personal history, including the reason for initiation, the relationship between masters and disciples, the process of learning, and shamanistic works, is closely related to the process of figuring out the transmission history of bonpuri, or reciting of shamanic epics by the simbang and its uniqueness.This study traces the lineage and genealogy of Park Bong-chun, a simbang in Seogwipo, Jeju－do, and looks at, in terms of space, how he has carried out his shamanistic works and activities. Park is an important figure in shamanism study as he contributed 16 works of bonpuri to “A Study on Korean Shamanism” by Akiba Dakasi and Akamas Jizo. This study, based on the recently obtained data including the draft of the genealogical record and the Park’s family registration record, discusses the genealogy of Park and the personal history as a simbang. As a result of the study, it has been found that the Parks, to which Park Bong-chun belongs, is traditionally the family of simbang whose basic nature lies in hereditary shamans, and they have carried out their shamanic rituals and ceremonies mainly in the Seogwipo area.As for the spaces, it has been found that the places for serving rituals and for their habitats are different. simbang Park Bong-chun and Park Ki-seok share the same lineage; they resided in Seoqwipo and conducted rituals and ceremonies for Yechon as maein simbang, a shaman responsible for a specific area. Park Saeng-ok engaged in shamanic activities mainly in Bonhyangdang in Seoqwipo and shares the same lineage with Park Jung-seok. Park Nam-ha is a close relative to Park Bong-chun and Park Ki-seok, but carried out his tasks in Gangjung. Lee In-ok, the daughter-in-law of Park Bong-chun, works mainly for Bonhyangdang in Topyeong. In short, although the simbangs all belong to the same Parks family, their shamanistic characteristics have become differentiated over time, with their spaces for shamanic ceremonies being divided and segmented. Such phenomenon seems quite natural for their livelihood and tasks.Comparison with bonpuri by each simbang in the Parks shows a unique characteristic and originality for each bonpuri, despite the fact that they all belong to the same family. This also means the transmission process of bonpuri by Jeju simbang is different from that of pansori. In this respect, this paper discusses the need for research into the transmission of bonpuri along with multilateral approach into simbang.In addition, this paper also includes the facts that:in light of the fact that some became a shaman after suffering from shamanistic initiatory illness, some of simbang are a hereditary shaman, yet carries some characteristics and qualities that shown in possessed shamans; the relationship has been clearly understood between Park Sang-ok, Park Ki-seok, and Park Nam-ha, who are introduced as informants for the previous research into shamanism in Jeju-do, such as studies on simbang Park Bong-chun and “A Dictionary of Jeju-do bonpuri Terminology” and simbang in the Parks family have come to conduct their rituals and ceremonies in differentareas over time according to their own style.
김기형	This paper looks into the characteristics of Jojo imagery shaped in pansori “Jeokbyeokga”, and examines their meaning in terms of the typical traditions of pansori performance. This paper also studies Bosung style pansori “Jeokbyeokga” and a few newly created works of changgeuk opera in which the heroic image of Jojo is displayed.Based on the Chinese classical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, “Jeokbyeokga” successfully constructed its own unique style through the process of Korean localization. In “Jeokbyeokga”, Jojo shows his distinctive characteristic, different from that depicted in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Most of the different versions of “Jeokbyeokga”, including Dongpyeonje style badi(바디), usually portray him as a cruel villain Villains in pansori not only arouse indignation, but create satire and humor, or Golgyemi(골계미 comic beauty) while delivering reality to some degree. This typical characteristic of villains also applies to Jojo represented in “Jeokbyeokga”. Although he is in a high position, Jojo is frivolous and wicked, and finally reduced to a common mortal after being defeated in the Battle of Red Cliff. Through his retreat to Hwayondo Island after the Jeokbyeok fire fight, the image of Jojo is completely fooledand ridiculed. Such image expressed in “Jeokbyeokga” shares common ground with other pansori including “Heungboga” and “Simcheongga”. The basic story line is commonly structured as ‘grim tragedy for the first half and humorous satire for the second half’. “Jeokbyeokga” also features the similar structure, with the character, Jojo, being placed in the center of the story. The warlord is often portrayed as a merciless villain, being subject to ridicule and mockery. He, however, is also shaped as a merciful ruler who embraces wounds and resentment of his subordinates. There is no doubt that Jojo is a villain, but his behavior draws out humor inside.In a similar vein, the Bosung style pansori of “Jeokbyeokga” attempts to express the heroic image of Jojo to some degree. In addition, changgeuk “Jeokbyeokga”, recently performed by the National Changgeuk Company of Korea, has successfully depicted Jojo in a grand and sublime manner, reflecting the image shown in the Bosung sori “Jeokbyeokga”. The aesthetics of Bosung sori was established after the 20thcentury, which stands in a different perspective from the traditional pansori. Given that changgeuk “Jeokbyeokga” and creative pansori opera “Jojo, A Hero amid Strife” bring out the heroic side of the character, Jojo, there’s good reason to portray him as a hero since Jojo has various images. However, compared to the aesthetic value achieved in the original pansori “Jeokbyeokga”, there remains much to be debated about the value and meaning of the newly created works. At any rate, the value of works should be appreciated in terms of quality, and certainly, Jojo is a character whose characteristics can be interpreted in wide different angles.
김기형	In the drumming methods of pansori, “imyeon” plays a critical role. Each drummer holds different views on how to interpret the aesthetics of imyeon, which makes it difficult to draw out common drumming methods for a wide application. This paper distinguishes the aesthetic values of imyeon in the drumming methods of pansori into four aspects: (1) the aesthetics of performing pansori rhythms in “hanbae (tempos of pansori rhythms)”; (2) the aesthetics of “introducing, developing, climaxing, and concluding”; (3) the aesthetics of void and filling; and (4) the aesthetics of chuimsae.The most basic yet important aspect for a sorikkun (singer) or gosoo (drum player) to remember when performing pansori is to maintain a harmonious tempo with the rhythm. This is known as “hanbae.” Drawing out a harmonious tempo between the sorikkun and gosoo is an important feature of hanbae. It becomes even more important at the “naedereum,” the opening phrase of each sori stuck and each jinyangjo tempo phrase. When performing “naedereum,” the gosoo arranges the rhythms of his drum according to conventional jangdan (rhythm) structures, not to pre-set or absolute rhythmic structures. For example, in a slow rhythmic pattern, such as in jinyang jangdan, the gosoo loosens or tightens the rhythms so that the sorikkun can display his excellent singing skill. Therefore, it is important for the gosoo to understand the tempo of the sorikkun to provide harmonious drum playing for imyeon.The basic structure of drum rhythms can be understood in terms of “introducing, developing, climaxing, and concluding,” which is called “gi-gyeong-gyeol-hae” in jinyang rhythm. In this concept of “gi-gyeong-gyeol-hae,” however, the meaning of “gi” or “introducing” is somewhat unclear. Moreover, there’s little difference between “gi” and “gyeong,” or developing, in terms of meaning. The “concluding” rhythm naturally comes after the “climaxing” rhythm. This means, therefore, that developing and climaxing are key to performing drum rhythms.The decision on which rhythm to use and under what circumstance, its arrangement, and managing its dynamics hold a significant meaning in the aesthetics of drumming techniques. Since all these factors vary based on each gosoo, there is no standard rule for different rhythms. The dynamics of drum rhythms are also related to the dramatic expressions of the pansori. For example, when expressing onomatopoeia, drum rhythms should also be in accordance with the onomatopoeia.Drum rhythms should also be performed bearing in mind the concept of “void” and “filling.” Drum rhythms cannot be based on “void” alone; at the same time, they cannot be delivered using too much “filling” either as too many rhythms would bury the sori’s voice. Unlike in the past, nowadays, “filling” rather than “void” seems to be gaining more importance.Chuimsae also has imyeon. Depending on different gosoo, chuimsae can be delivered concisely or actively. In any case, gosoo have to deliver chuimsae in harmony with the sori of sorikkun, thereby producing perfect imyeon. For example, when pansori is performed in a high tone, chuimsae should also be in a high tone, while for a sad scene, chuimsae should take on a sad tone. Drawing out chuimsae from the audience and delivering their power to sorikkun is also one important role of the gosoo, making the performance more dynamic.Soribook, the drum played in pansori, is a simple yet charming percussion instrument that can deliver various tones and expressions depending on whether it is played on the right side, the left side, the upper part, or the front part of the soribook. If pansori is the art of delivering emotions, the rhythms of soribook complement those emotions. Hence, the imyeon of drum rhythms is as important as that of the sori. When it comes to defining drumming techniques, a forced analogy or a far-fetched interpretation should be avoided. This is not an easy task, but there are multilateral approaches to define the common principles on which drumming techniques should be based.
김기형	In Pansori, there are two kinds of linguistic levels. One is superstratum and the other is substratum. The former is a normative language which represents the formal culture based on authoritative statements and elegant expressions, the latter is an ignominious language which represents the informal culture based on abusive statements and sexual expressions. Those two dual layered languages are mixed in Pansori because people in Choson dynasty used Chinese characters along with Korean.It is possible to find the superstratum which is usually found in Chinese charactered expressions because there are not only Kwangdaes but also Yangban intellectuals in the group of pansori’s scriptwriter. Chinese charactered expressions show tragic beauty and solemn aesthetic. Also, sometimes it contains the parody skills that reveal the humorous effect. Nowadays, people sometimes start to try to change the whole Chinese charactered expression to Korean styled expression for the popularization of pansori. At this point, we have to consider maintaining the stylistic effect of Chinese charactered expression.On the other hands, the substratum written in Korean is usually found when people of lower class appears or in the part of humorous scenes. The substratum is closely related to the Cholla province dialects. The most part of pansori’s script are based on the Cholla province dialects expecially in the part of Aniri.The height and length of tone, rhythmic flow, and sentimentality are the significant features of Cholla province dialects and those develop the core linguistic aesthetics of pansori.
김정숙	This study aims to highlight that the syllabus design and curriculum development of ‘Sejong Korean 1~8’, the textbook developed for King Sejong Institute from 2011-13. ‘Sejong Korean 1~8’ corresponds to the "Common Framework of Reference for Korean Language Education and Evaluation Level 1 to 4". The contents for ‘Sejong Korean 1~8’ are selected from teaching material within the framework and is essential to the education of King Sejong Institute. Then, the items are readjusted to reflect the needs of the teachers at the institute. The syllabus design of ‘Sejong Korean 1~8’ takes an eclectic approach, which fundamentally aims to promote communicative competence as well as linguistic components, such as grammar and vocabulary. The following are the components of lesson for ‘Sejong Korean 1~8’: An introductory picture and question, teaching goal, extensions of vocabulary, dialogue 1 and 2, vocabulary, grammar, practice 1 and 2, listening and speaking, reading and writing, new vocabulary, and self evaluation. As ‘Sejong Korean 5~8’ focuses on the increasing importance of vocabulary, an extension of vocabulary is included as a new component of the lessons.
김정숙	The aim of this study is an analysis of conversation textbooks published in the beginning of the 20th century for Korean learners of Japanese in terms of content and presentation style. To this end, seven textbooks have been selected that focus on the conversation among the books published at that time. I researched how the criteria of the textbook units is arranged, the presentation of the dialogue, the way the authors mark the speakers of the dialogue, and whether or not they have translations and phonetic value of dialogue in Japanese. In addition, I researched the change of overall content and presentation style over time. In conclusion, the features of conversation textbooks for Korean learners of Japanese have changed over time. At first, most textbooks were organized by subjects and situations such as daily life, personal relationships and friendships, nature, jobs, and business. Next, the textbooks began to include practical dialogues relating to daily life, friendships, and jobs at the beginning, but the subjects they dealt with were shifted towards business contexts and abstract concepts. After the year 1910 when colonization over Korean was full-fledged, content for teachers and civil servants was fortified and policemen textbooks were published. Thirdly, sentences for practicing conversation were presented as dialogue or isolated sentences; mixed forms of sentences also appeared in the same units. When dialogues were used they cannot be completed in terms of meaning. Fourthly, even though their focuses are conversation, five textbooks do not have the title of the speakers. Five textbooks present sentences marked with numbers.One textbook presented sentences without any marks. Fifthly, all textbooks presented Korean sentences with a Japanese translation, and only one book includes phonetic value. Finally, Six textbooks have a vocabulary section that comprise of semantic parts with dialogue. Among them, five textbooks present vocabulary by subject, such as daily life, interpersonal and social relations and business related words. These words strongly reflected situations of those times.
김정숙	The purpose of this study is to develop an online level test for King Sejong Institute(KSI). This test measures the level of ability of Korean learners so that they can be placed on an appropriate course within the standard curriculum of the KSI standard. To the end this study analyzes the curriculum and test of KSI and conduct needs analysis of teachers at KSI. To figure out the procedures of taking a test through online this study researches on other kinds of online tests. This study sets up the test objective and decides test area and level of test. Then the key components of test such as types and numbers of test item, proper time for the test, the level of difficulties of each test items and scoring method, and report of test result as well as test structure are suggested. In addition to this, the ways of reporting score of test depending on test constructs are investigated in order to contribute the upcoming teaching and learning at KSI. For those students who want to study by themselves through Nuri-Sejong website, this study considers the mechanism to recommend proper learning contents at Nuri-Sejong website.
김정숙	Kim Jiyoung & Kim Chungsook. 2015. 3. 31. A Basic Research to Develop Korean Writing Curriculum as a Liberal Education for International Students in University: Focusing on the textbook analysis by the principle of developing writing textbook. Bilingual Research 58, 1-31. This paper is a basic research to develop Korean writing curriculum as a liberal education of university. Therefore it critically examines the existing researches on writing education and suggests the goal of writing education and the principle of developing writing textbooks. And based on this, it analyzes writing textbooks for international students of university. It also tries to figure out current educational environment to suggest a new curriculum. An analysis of educational environment on a theoretical perspective is the examination on the existing studies and a practical perspective is a review of writing textbooks. From the former, this paper could draw a goal and principle of Korean writing education as a liberal education for international students different from both writing in Korean language education curriculum for general purpose and writing as a liberal education for domestic students. And from the latter, it has found out that current Korean writing textbooks do not consider the characteristics of international students of university when contents are chosen and organized. It is because they do not fully understand what are academic texts, not have sufficient amount of practices, and not give detailed procedures.(Korea University)
김정숙	The purpose of this study is to explore politeness strategies found in conversations through mobile messaging application (MMA).MMA, which is represented by Kakao Talk in Korea, is the most frequently used application on smartphones, and now MMA communication seems to be replacing traditional telephone or even face-to-face conversations. However, unlike telephone or face-to-face conversations, MMA communication lacks prosodic and supralinguistic features which are very important parts of communication. Therefore, people try to manage MMA conversations not to be misunderstood their intentions. The current study analyzed some group conversations and one-on-one conversations made through Kakao Talk and investigated politeness strategies. Firstly, people make use of wide range of stylistic variations, from very formal written style to non-standard casual style, to regulate the atmosphere of the conversation. Secondly, there appear lots of attempts to build rapport among conversation participants using emoticons, slangs, and many non-standard internet jargons. Also, people use lots of collaborative tokens such as back-channeling and onomatopoeic and mimetic expressions. Thirdly, there appear many adjacent pairs which are separated by many turns, which is rare in oral conversations. Thus, people try to respond their conversation partners even after a long time. Fourthly, it appears that MMA users try to avoid imposing others for responding quickly: delayed or lack of response and omission of opening or closing remarks seem to be well understood. At the same time they appear to feel obligation of responding as quickly as possible. This study concludes that MMA enables people maintain social relationship widely, respecting each other’s privacy and politeness is considered importantly but not strictly.
김정숙	This article aims to describe how to design metadata for item bank - based Korean proficiency test. With the progress of computer technology, the techniques for assessing foreign language competency are also rapidly being developed. a number of large-scaled, high-risk proficiency tests such as ‘iBT TOEFL’, ‘TOEIC’, ‘IELTS’ and ‘HSK’ have already adopted computer-based item bank testing systems. However no large-scaled Korean proficiency test is implemented by computer-based or internet-based item bank system. Item banking of a Korean proficiency test enables test items to be accumulated, retrieved, upgraded with ease. To enables these functions, each item needs to be described with metadata, which is information about the assessment item, and can be highly detailed key fields. Therefore, designing metadata schemes and standard are to establish a foundation of a computer or internet-based item bank system for a future Korean proficiency test.This article studies the basic functions that item bank for a Korean proficiency test can perform, researches metadata of other item banking systems, and suggest the framework of metadata standards for an item bank based - Korean proficiency test.
김정숙	The objective of this study is to propose a means of revising the standard curricula of King Sejong Institute, a leading establishment that promotes Korean language and culture. Its current programs vary by region, depending on the educational environment of respective countries. There is also a need to develop the standard educational programs that incorporates newly developed textbooks, “Sejong Korean language conversation” and “Sejong Korean culture”, into the presently used “Sejong Korean”. To this end, we conducted an online survey for 283 people, including the institute’s faculty, administrators, and program managers, to examine how the institute’s standard program is being managed and how the newly developed textbooks are being used. On the basis of early studies and the survey result, we developed a proposal on revising the standard curricula of King Sejong Institute and managing the revised curricula. For flexible curricula management, we propose three levels of program hours: 45 52 hours for Ga(A) type, 53 75 hours for Na(B) type, and 76 104 hours for Da(C) type. Furthermore, we propose an operational model for the institute’s curricula that covers all the three above mentioned textbooks.

A Basic Study on the Development of a Korean Proficiency Test Targeted for Young & Adolescent Learners -Based on setting standard levels and sections-. Journal of Korean Language Education 28-1: 221-250. This study aims to discuss the basic foundations to set levels and language skills for developing a Korean Proficiency Test for young and adolescent learners. Recently, there has been an increase in demand regarding young and adolescent learners from multicultural and overseas backgrounds. However, the current Korean Proficiency Test lacks the appropriate means to determine the Korean proficiency of young and adolescent learners with general purposes of language learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing a specialized and new form of language assessment for young and adolescent learners who are exposed to a foreign language or a second language learning environment. The study examines and analyzes cases of foreign language examinations for young & adolescent learners; furthermore, the objectives and target were set based on the results of a needs analysis and in-depth interviews conducted among teachers and education officials in overseas Korean Hangeul Schools, international schools, elementary and secondary schools. Finally, the levels and language skills appropriate for the objectives of a proficiency test and target learners have been suggested.

김정숙	This study aims to establish the constructs of oral proficiency tests in Korean, which could contribute to development of a large-scale speaking test of Korean. Test tasks of this study are independent discourse production which is suited for semi-direct tests that maximize the practicality of the test while also examining the performance of test takers at an intermediate level. To achieve the goal, this study reviews theories and research related to the constructs of oral proficiency tests in Korean including theories based on communicative competence. This study also investigates and analyzes what kind of abilities an expert group of Korean language educators possess regarding constructs of oral proficiency by establishing their own beliefs about constructs of oral proficiency, then changing the constructs after listening to the utterances of test-takers. Based on this, it suggests seven abilities as constructs of oral proficiency in Korean: task ability, content ability, discourse ability, interaction ability, linguistic ability, sociolinguistic ability, pronunciation ability and delivery ability.

김정숙	As the number of TOPIK(Test of Proficiency in Korean) takers has been soaring, the test location and date is going to be added, which is supposed to cause some difficulties in administering TOPIK such as writing items, executing, scoring. It is necessary for the existing paper-based TOPIK to change into a computer-based one or internet-based one with an item banking system. This study presents how to specify the general information on item which is the fundamental material to introduce an item banking system for Korean proficiency test such as TOPIK. That is, out of information constructing metadata of items of the banking system, the general information on item is developed with detailed specifications. First, 22 factors of general information on item are selected including ‘information process, assessment objective, discourse type, discourse function, and direction type.’ Next, analyzing the items in the previous TOPIK, the detailed item information is rearranged according to the specified factors. Then, reviewing those detailed item information it was reclassified and added with the information left out in accordance with the specified factors to fit introducing an item banking system. The general information on item in each section of reading, listening, and writing of Korean proficiency test is presented in detail.

This article explores the developmental history of TOPIK over the last 20 years and its recent trends. Over the last two decades, TOPIK underwent two major systematic reforms, achieving both quantitative and qualitative growth over the course of its 52 testing sessions. TOPIK has utilized a six-level evaluation system from its inception to the present. The evaluation system was amended from the earlier six-test set - whereby each level corresponded with a separate test (1997~2005: the 1st~9th) - to the three-test set (2006~2014: the 10th~34th), and finally to the two-test set (2014~present: the 35th~42nd). In the earlier exams, abilities in VocabularyÂ· Grammar, Writing, Listening, and Reading were assessed. However, beginning with the 35th TOPIK, abilities in Listening, Reading, and Writing (only in TOPIK II) were assessed and the evaluation of the writing section was changed to a task-based process, improving TOPIK into a more qualified analysis of proficiency. Over the last 20 years, the number of countries TOPIK is administered in has greatly increased from 4 to 73 countries, and the annual number of test-takers has also significantly increased from 2,692 to 250,141. The distribution of proficiency levels of the test-takers has shifted over time - initially “Beginner>Intermediate>Advanced” in the earlier exams, to “Intermediate>Advanced>Beginner” after the mid 2000s - as the number of those studying the Korean language for specific purposes and continuing education increased. Test-takers have indicated a shift in their purpose for taking the exam, initially citing “to assess proficiency” and more recently selecting “to study abroad,” and this could also correlate with changes in the proportion of test-takers’ proficiency level. In general, 85~95% of beginner, 50~65% of intermediate, and 45~60% of advanced test applicants passed the respective proficiency level. To date, no practices have yet been implemented to standardize the difficulty level longitudinally across test sets. (Korea University)
김정숙	Ahn Su-hyun & Kim Chung-sook. 2017. A Study on the Features of Writing Rater in TOPIK Writing Assessment. Journal of Korean Language Education 28-1: 173-196. Writing is a subjective and performative activity. Writing ability has multi-facets and compoundness. To understand the examinees’s writing ability accurately and provide effective writing scores, raters first ought to have the competency regarding assessment. Therefore, this study is significant as a fundamental research about rater’s characteristics on the TOPIK writing assessment. 150 scripts of the 47th TOPIK examinees were selected randomly, and were further rated independently by 20 raters. The many-facet Rasch model was used to generate individualized feedback reports on each rater’s relative severity and consistency with respect to particular categories of the rating scale. This study was analyzed using the FACETS ver 3.71.4 program.Overfit and misfit raters showed many difficulties for noticing the difference between assessment factors and interpreting the criteria. Writing raters appear to have much confusion when interpreting the assessment criteria, and especially, overfit and misfit teachers interpret the criteria arbitrarily. The main reason of overfit and misfit is the confusion about assessment factors and criteria in finding basis for scoring. Therefore, there needs to be more training and research is needed for raters based on this type of writing assessment characteristics. This study is recognized significantly in that it collectively examined writing assessment characteristics of writing raters, and visually confirmed the assessment error aspects of writing assessment.

김종훈	This study is an attempt to trace the criteria of distinction for Play in the Moon Country, the volume of poetry by Kim, Soo-Young, which was published in 1959, and pays attention to especially his poems written between 1953 and 1956, which the ratios of inclusion in the volume were same. The poems of Kim, Soo-Young in that time, are characterized with detailed expressions on the surrounding of daily lives and the unknown world. And then, his poems showed clearly undeveloped realities of Korea as well as the possibilities of modernity and universality. The modern western things were invading into the retarded reality, causing sorrows. The feeling sorrow mixed with individual and universal emotion was an expression of hope that it would enter into the unknown world which was set. Even though it might be considered as the poet's own individual feeling, he tried to think of the outside within the Korean reality in the 1950's.
김종훈	This study is an attempt to trace his aesthetic direction for Play in the Moon Country, the volume of poetry by Kim, Soo-Young, which was published in 1959, and pays attention to especially his poems written between 1957 and July 1959. In this period, which can be called the establishment of poetry standards, he attempted to include family and neighbors to the poetic range, adding humor and love. In addition, he attempted to find the origin of poetic language and to secure prospects in unknown world. The meaning of Play in the Moon Country is to preoccupy the characteristics of Kim Soo-young's poems in the 1960s, which affirmed the tradition and history, rediscovered the meaning of love, and conducted linguistic experiments. Therefore, the significance of this study is to add a basis to the view of Kim Soo-young's whole world as continuity and consistency rather than disconnection.
김종훈	Based on Yi Sang’s real life, this study attempted to trace the characteristics and relevance of ‘Ruk-Dan(易斷)’ series and ‘Wi-dok(危篤)’ series published in 1936. In the early winter of 1936, harsh in business, affection, and cold, he broke his habit of writing poetry and showed changed poetic characteristics. The ‘Ruk-Dan(易斷)’ series, released in February, consisted of poems that broke Yi Sang’s practice of releasing poems only in the summer. The reactions to the blood and cold are reflected directly in the poem, and the meaning of Yi Sang’s poems is further enriched by the appearance of an honest and serious speaker based on experience. In October, when he recovered some of his health, he released a series of ‘Wi-dok(危篤)’ experiments with language based on real life. It has two origins. One is the spirit of experimentation originating from Japanese poetry and the ‘A Crow’s-eye-view(烏瞰圖)’ series, and the other is the pain of experience from the ‘Ruk-Dan(易斷)’ series. Yi Sang’s poem reached its aesthetic climax in his last two poem series in 1936.
김종훈	This thesis is a study of the aspect and meaning of 'emotion' appearing in Oh, Jang-hwan 's second and third collection of poems, Tribute and Where I Live. When he released his first collection of poems, Oh, Jang-hwan paid attention to humans and reality as a new literary requirement. The 1920s 'New trend wave' and 'KAPF poetry', which are examples of this, belong to realistic literature, but they also express emotions on the other side of intellectual language. Tribute and Where I Live is an eruption of emotion, which is distinguished from modern poetry of the day and the first collection of poems, The Wall. Tribute is a collection of tragic feelings about the bridle of destiny in the background of the mythical world. Here, hometown is death, and all-around life is youth or life. The sorrow stemming from the perception of the fundamental world was the aesthetics of modern poetry as he understood it. In Where I Live, both the range of the emotional object and the type of emotional expression were expanded. Interest in common realities such as solidarity and anticipation is shown in the collection. Where I Live is a collection of poems that serves as a stepping stone from the past to the future, from individuals to society, from vanity to pride. Oh Jang-hwan paid attention to human beings in Tribute, attention to reality in Where I Live and gave order to the characteristics of his somewhat distracted collections.
김혜령	This paper analyzes meaning of first person pronouns based on analysis of meaning conditions. first person pronouns have meaning that speaker represents speaker’s own self in common. However they have difference of meaning through relationships of speaker and hearer. This character is explained by analysis of meaning conditions. This paper reveals meanings and meaning conditions of first person pronouns ‘na’, ‘woori’, ‘jeo’ and ‘jeohui’. The meaning and its condition of ‘na’ is the basics of the other first person pronouns. In terms of ‘jeo’, is added relation of speaker and hearer and attitude of speaker in meaning condition of ‘na’. ‘Woori’ and ‘jeohui’ is the plural form of ‘na’ and ‘jeo’. Similarities of meaning and its conditions are found, whereas differences of meaning on account of the meaning condition are found in sociocultural context.
김혜령	This paper shows that there are expressions based on proverbs. Semantic characteristics of proverbs are metaphoric, satiric and instructive. This is, because of proverbs are to function as a lexeme. An expressions based on a proverb has an intimate relationship formally and semantically with the proverb. Expressions based on proverbs are classified as; One is a expression that uses words in a proverb, the other is a expression that does not use words in a proverb. The fixedness of proverb has been weakened, then proper parts are divided. The divided parts are expressions based on proverbs. The independence of expressions based on a proverbs is strengthened by inference of similarity. Expressions based on proverbs has a metaphoric characteristic, not satiric and instructive characteristic.
김흥규	This paper aims to show some issues on Sejong Corpus of Historical Korean, and to suggest some accordant solutions. Not being big enough, the corpus must be highly verified with the original texts for a quantative method to be run through. Then it will also allow the corpus to be a handy reference of the original texts for the word or phrase the retriever is looking at. In case of the latter, it would be better when there is a system which links the text of the corpus to the image of it.
노정은	This study has aim of finding a linguistic way for students in multi-cultural family to improve mathematical performance capability facing with math word problems. To solve math word problems, students are not only influenced by mathematical factor, but also influenced by linguistic one. In this sense, we focused on the math word problems presented in the third-grade math book, and tried to find distinct features and problems of them. As a result, we found that vocabulary not mostly used and complicated sentences having many phrases were seen frequently. Also, mathematical terms presented in every chapter should be taught in advance because they are core contents. In this study, we propose a step approach for the students and set up three steps of basic calculation capability, enhancing their linguistic adaptability, and actual solving of math word problems.
노정은	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the expression-driven literature therapy program on the interpersonal competency of university students. For this, it was to examine the interpersonal capacity before and after the literacy therapy program. Literature therapy program was modified by Kim Sung-bum(2015)'s expression-driven literature therapy program. The subjects of this study were 16 students from Jeonbuk W-university and 8 students were assigned to experimental group and control group.The results showed that the expression-driven literature therapy program improves the sensitivity of the interpersonal relationship of university students to the degree that they see and feel about others, while reducing the sense of distance when communicating with others. And it helps to express in better direction.Therefore, it is meaningful that this study proved that the expression-driven literature therapy program is reconstructed and implemented to improve the interpersonal relationship of university students. In addition, it is significant that university students helped them to improve their relationship with others by understanding themselves.
노정은	This study is aimed at implementing and verifying the effect of affirmation psychology program based on mindfulness on psychological well-being of adolescents. For this, researchers developed and revised the program through considering the preceding researches and professionals investigation after designing that program.The experiment was designed by experimental and controlled group with 100 students of middle school in second grade. The affirmation psychology program developed by researchers was applied and implemented by each 50 minutes to experimental group, totally 10 sessions.The results of this study are as follows. The students participated in this program were improved significantly in the aspect of psychological well-being comparing the students who were not involved at this program. Friend relationship, control of environment, personal growth, the optimistic thinking, the purpose of life, positive self-awareness, self-assertiveness, and internal attribution of the students in experimental group were improved significantly.
노정은	The purpose of this study is to analyze the patterns of language use shown in information delivery presentations materials written by foreign undergraduates. To accomplish this, a total of 24 information delivery presentations were collected over the first and second semesters of the 2016 academic year. The data analysis was based on four dimensions: composition, content presentation, language expression, and readability editing. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there was a lack of awareness of introduction, main text, conclusion, reference, and title presentation when composing a presentation at the composition level while the contents was reviewed by classifying the type of failure to suggest summary. In the language expression level, informal expressions, translation expressions, expressions that are not used in the academic discourse community are used. In the editing the readability level, we can see that it should be constructed to help the audience understand the contents considering the them.

신지영	This paper re-visits the meaning of 喉 (hu) in the Hunminjeongeum Haerye. It aims to show the problems and limitations in understanding hu sound in the current theoretical discussions on this sound as well as the alternative view on 喉 (hu). In doing so, this paper develops an in-depth analysis on ‘a’ sound (molar), ‘seol’ sound (lingual), ‘sun’ sound (labial), ‘chi’ sound (incisor) and ‘hu’ sound (described as laryngeal sounds thus far). We shows that hu sound is in fact not made in the larynx nor the glottis but is articulated at the edge of oral cavity in the ㄱ-shaped passage created by the oral and glottal cavities. This representation of hu sound helps our understanding of the Hunminjeongeum Haerye. Firstly, we can better understand the meaning of ‘sel-geun-pye-hwu’ (舌根閉喉), which refers to the shape of the root of the tongue blocking the pharynx. Secondly, we can demonstrate the phonetic similarity between the old iung ( ) and the iung (ㅇ). Thirdly, we can also understand why iung (ㅇ) is used underneath the labial as in ㅸ and why it is mentioned that there are many hu sound in the Hunminjeongeum. Finally, we can explain the phonetic similarities between ㅇ and ㆆ.
신지영	Objectives:The C-unit is a basic unit for school-aged children's spoken language analysis, and was developed for English speaking children.The purpose of this paper is to provide a guide for C-unit and clause segmentation applicable to Korean and to analyze school-aged children's narrative and yield the reliability. Methods: A total of 48 typically developing children in grade 1, 3, and 5 participated in this study. They were asked to generate narratives and the narratives were recorded and transcribed. The narratives were analyzed based on a new version of the segmentation guide in the number of eojeol (a Korean morphological unit) and words per C-unit, the number of adnominal clauses, adverbial clauses, nominal clauses and quoted clauses per C-unit and the number of total subordinate clauses and total clauses per C-unit. And interrater agreement was calculated. Results: With the exception of nominal clauses which were infrequently used, all the other measures increased as children moved to higher grades. And a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the performance of the three grade groups. There were significant differences among the three grade groups. And interrater agreement of C-unit and clause segmentation between the first researcher and the second researcher was 93.52% and 95.0%, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that the elaborate guide for C-unit and clause segmentation for Korean can be a useful tool. School-aged children's syntactic maturity was observed when we applied it to their narratives. And interrater agreement of C-unit and clause segmentation was high.

Despite large individual differences in grapheme-color association, synesthetes tend to associate graphemes sharing a perceptual feature with similar synesthetic colors. Sound has been suggested as one such feature. In the present study, we investigated whether graphemes of which representative phonemes have similar phonetic features tend to be associated with analogous synesthetic colors. We tested five Korean multilingual synesthetes on a color-matching task using graphemes from Korean, English, and Japanese orthography. We then compared the similarity of synesthetic colors induced by those characters sharing a phonetic feature. Results showed that graphemes associated with the same phonetic feature tend to induce synesthetic color in both within-and cross-script analyses. Moreover, this tendency was consistent for graphemes that are not transliterable into each other as well as graphemes that are. These results suggest that it is the perceptual-i.e., phonetic-properties associated with graphemes, not just conceptual associations such as transliteration, that determine synesthetic color.
신지영	This paper dealt with how realization of pauses in utterance is affected by speech style, gender, and generation. For this purpose, we analyzed the frequency and duration of pauses. Pauses were categorized into four types: pause with breath, pause with no breath, utterance medial pause, and utterance final pause. Forty-eight subjects living in Seoul were chosen from the Korean Standard Speech Database. All subjects engaged in reading and spontaneous speech, through which we could also compare the realization between the two speech styles. The results showed that utterance final pauses had longer durations than utterance medial pauses. It means that utterance final pause has a function that signals the end of an utterance to the audience. For difference between tasks, spontaneous speech had longer and more frequent pauses because of cognitive reasons. With regard to gender variables, women produced shorter and less frequent pauses. For male speakers, the duration of pauses with breath was significantly longer. Finally, for generation variable, older speakers produced more frequent pauses. In addition, the results showed several interaction effects. Male speakers produced longer pauses, but this gender effect was more prominent at the utterance final position.
신지영	In this paper, we proposed a new academic debating model called 'Jiphyean Debate' as an opening debate system. We pointed out some limitations of the previous academic debates such as pros and cons debate, and stressed the necessity of a new debate model. We proposed the 'Jiphpeon Debate' as a new three-party debating model. We believe that the 'Jiphpeon Debate' model overcomes several limitations of the previous two-party model. As a three-party model, Jiphyeon Debate avoids the inflexible pros and cons opposition and guarantees the communication and cooperation among participants. The main characteristics of the Jiphyeon Debate can be summarized as follows: openness, flexibility, practicality and problem-solving ability. As an educational debate, the Jiphyeon Debate model can help students to have opportunity to exchange diversified views with a respectful attitude and to excercise problem-solving strategies.
신지영	This paper aims at investigating the prosodic markers and morphological markers in spoken Korean. Prosody, especially intonation, has linguistic and paralinguistic meanings in spoken Korean. As is well-known, prosody plays important role in spoken language: it is hard to determine whether a word(or a eojeol) is realized at the sentence final or non-final position without consulting the prosody. Only an exception is that a word(or eojeol) ends with a typical sentence final ending such as ‘–다, -냐, -라, -자’. Therefore, we can categorize two types of endings in Korean: clause terminal endings and sentence terminal endings. A eojeol with a clause terminal ending, which is categorized as a connective ending in the previous studies, terminates a sentence only with a terminal boundary tone. It does not terminates a sentence with a non-terminal boundary tone. On the other hand, a eojeol with a sentence terminal ending, which is categorized as a terminal ending in the previous studies, always terminates a sentence with a unmarked terminal boundary tone. The unmarked terminal boundary tone depends on the ending types: H% for the interrogative ending (e.g. {-냐), L% for the rests. Marked terminal boundary tone with sentence terminal ending only changes paralinguistic modal meaning of the sentence. It does not change the linguistic category of the sentence type, which is realized with the morphological marker(i.e. sentence terminal ending type). Only paralinguistic modal meaning changes in this case. On the other hand, when a eojeol does not end with a sentence terminal ending, a sentence can close off with terminal boundary tone and cannot close off with non-terminal boundary tone. In this case, terminal boundary tone can have linguistic meaning as well as paralinguistic modal meaning.
신지영	The purpose of the paper is to analyse current status of assignment instruction in college classroom, and to suggest points where special attentions need to be paid and require further improvement in order to achieve productive assignment control. A survey for both lecturers and students was conducted to look into how coursework is assigned, accomplished, how feedback and evaluation were given in college classroom today. Meanwhile, interviews of 'excellent lecturer' award winners were conducted to identify what's to be considered and improved in assignment management. The results shown that lecturer needs to have a clear vision of assignment goal and purpose, while timing, evaluation standard and feedback of assignments are important as well. Lecturers believed that successful assignments can help deepen students' understanding towards course contents, to encourage students to apply and extend the course contents and participate actively in class. For students, assignments believed to help deepen understanding towards course contents. Meanwhile fair evaluation and instruction are also important in team assignments.
신지영	Vowel raising in Korean has been primarily treated as a phonological, categorical change. This study aims to show how the Korean connective suffix {-go} is realized in various environments, and propose a principle of vowel raising based on both acoustic and perceptual data. To that end, we used a corpus of spoken Korean to analyze the types of syntactic constructions, the realization of prosodic boundaries (IP and PP), and the types of boundary tone associated with {-go}. It was found that the vowel tends to be raised most frequently in utterance-final position, while in utterance-medial position the vowel was raised more when the syntactic and prosodic distance between {-go} and the following constituent was smaller. The results for boundary tone also showed a correlation between vowel raising and the discourse function of the boundary tone. In conclusion, we propose that vowel raising is not simply an optional phenomenon, but rather a type of phonetic reduction related to the comprehension of the following constituent.
신지영	This study was performed to investigate acoustic characteristics of sustained vowels produced by Seoul Korean speakers. For this study, three hundred nine healthy adults were chosen as participants from Korean Standard Speech Database. These subjects were divided into five chronological age groups (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60–70s) and two gender groups (male and female). Fundamental frequency (f0), jitter, shimmer, and NHR (noise-to-harmonics ratio) was measured with 8 Korean vowels (/ɑ/, /a/, /ʌ/, /e/, /o/, /u/, /ɯ/, /i/) by using Praat. The results showed that the vowel type significantly affected all acoustic parameters. Gender affected f0, jitter, and NHR significantly. The mean female speakers’ f0 was greater than the males’, and the mean jitter and NHR of male speakers was greater than the females’. Moreover, age affected shimmer and NHR significantly; in particular, the shimmer and NHR of elderly speakers was greater than the young speakers.
신지영	This study aims to investigate the acoustic properties of monophthongs from Seoul speakers in their 20s through 60s. Results show that (1) speakers in their 60s exhibit a greater spectral difference between /e/ and /ɛ/ than the other age groups; (2) /ɯ/ is more fronted in speakers younger than 60; (3) more fronting of /ɯ/ is observed in speakers in their 20s than older groups with respect to /a/; and (4) no significant difference is found between /o/ and /u/ in all age groups.
신지영	This paper aims to show how prosody affects efficiency in communication through the case study of two ‘good’(i.e., highly-rated) speakers and two ‘poor’ (i.e., poorly-rated) speakers among 12 speakers whose performance was judged by 100 raters. Each speaker was given materials to talk about 2-3 days ago and then they were asked to talk about one theme given earlier. Their speech was recorded and further prosodic analysis was conducted. In the study, prosodic structure, speech rate (with or without pause) and speech duration as well as location and pattern of pause were measured and analysed.The results of the present study are summarized as follows: The proportion of pause is about 15-16% of the total speech for the highly-rated speaker’s speech, whereas the proportion goes up over 25% in the case of poorly-rated speakers’ speech. In terms of speech rate, the highly-rated speakers produce about 6 syllables per second and their counterparts produce about 5 syllables per second. The highly-rated speakers produce phonological phrases (pp) 10% more but regards the intonational phrase (IP), 10% less compared to the poorly-rated speakers. That is, the highly-rated speakers’ speech were composed of about 70% of PP and 20% of IPs.The poorly-rated speakers also tend to place the pause at the end of IP more frequently than the highly-rated speakers. The average speech length between pauses is found to be longer in the utterance of the highly-rated speakers than the poorly-rated speakers. Yet, the standard deviation of the duration between pauses is larger in the highly-rated speakers’ speech than the poorly-rated speakers’ speech. This study shows some prosodic characteristics of efficient speech. Research on this would be beneficial in language education.
신지영	This paper aims at proposing issues of breath and memory in speech based on the quantitative analysis of breath groups and pause units in Korean. As a human being, we have two kinds of limitations on continuing speech; breath and memory. The prosodic structure and temporal structure of spontaneous speech data from six speakers were closely examined. One of the main findings of the present study is that the prosodic structure and temporal structure of Korean appears to reflect the breath and memory problems in speech.
신지영	This study investigated the interaction between phonological phrase boundary and word frequency variable in Korean speech processing. A word monitoring task was performed to examine the interference caused by the frequency effect of target word depending on whether a phonological phrase is formed within the target word. Frequency of target word (high vs low) and phonological phrase boundary (within target word vs between target words) were applied as between and within subject condition respectively. Our results showed the significant main effect of the phonological phrase boundary and the significant interaction. In the post-hoc analysis, the high-frequency target words were detected significantly faster than the low-frequency target words only in the within phonological phrase boundary condition. Frequency effect in the between phonological phrase boundary condition did not appear. The results indicated that the phonological phrase boundary and word frequency variable played an important role in Korean speech processing. In particular, we discussed the possibility of processing the word frequency at the very early sensory information processing stage based on the interaction of two experimental factors.
신지영	The aim of this paper is to study the morphemization of {Geuraegajigo} based on a spontaneous speech corpus. For this purpose, the distributions, the semantic functions, and the intonational phrase pattterns of the connective {Geuraegajigo} have been analyzed based on the corpus. The results are as follow; at first, coalescence that comes with a morphemization process was found, resulting in many variations. Secondly, there are three functions of it: [Direct/Indirect interrelationship], [Enumerate conjunction], and [Discourse marker]. And this semantic/functional diversity has many similarities with conjunctive adverbs. Lastly, intonational phrase patterns of {Geuraegajigo} accord with those of conjunctive adverbs. Especially, the discourse strategic IP pattern is connected with the short variation type. In conclusion, {Geuraegajigo} has finished turning into a conjunctive adverb through morphemization.
신지영	In this paper, we attempted to discover the correlation between syntactic units and prosodic units. For this purpose, we focused on a syntactic unit “clause,” the highest unit in a sentence, and a prosodic unit “intonational phrase,” the highest unit in an utterance. We analyzed the realization of intonational phrases at non-final clause boundaries, and their prosodic properties in “mal-geul bi-gyo sil-heom II,” a Korean corpus of spontaneous speech. The results showed that the higher the degree of syntactic independency of a clause is, the more frequently an intonational phrase boundary occurs at the clause boundary. Intonational phrases in clauses with higher syntactic independency also have more typical prosodic properties than others in clauses with lower syntactic independency. It is suggested that realization of intonational phrase at a clause boundary shows the recognition of Korean speakers about the syntactic distance between the clauses, and that intonational units in Korean are not realized arbitrarily but systemically.
신지영	This paper deals with how speech rate in Korean is affected by the sociolinguistic factors such as region, gender and generation. Speech rate was quantified as articulation rate (excluding physical pauses) and speaking rate (including physical pauses), both expressed as the number of syllables per second (sps). Other acoustic measures such as pause frequency and duration were also examined. Four hundred twelve subjects were chosen from Korean Standard Speech Database considering their age, gender and region. The result shows that generation has a significant effect on both speaking rate and articulation rate. Younger speakers produce their speech with significantly faster speaking rate and articulation rate than older speakers. Mean duration of total pause interval and the total number of pause of older speakers are also significantly different to those of younger speakers. Gender has a significant effect only on articulation rate, which means male speakers’ speech rate is characterized by faster articulation rate, longer and more frequent pauses. Finally, region has no effect both on speaking and articulation rates.
신지영	The data accumulated in this database will be used to develop a speaker identification system. This may also be appliedtowards, but not limited to, fields of phonetic studies, sociolinguistics, and language pathology. We plan to supplement thelarge-scale speech corpus next year, in terms of research methodology and content, to better answer the needs of diversefields. The purpose of this study is to develop a speech corpus for standard Korean speech. For the samples to viablyrepresent the state of spoken Korean, demographic factors were considered to modulate a balanced spread of age, gender, anddialects. Nine separate regional dialects were categorized, and five age groups were established from individuals in their 20sto 60s. A speech-sample collection protocol was developed for the purpose of this study where each speaker performs fivetasks: two reading tasks, two semi-spontaneous speech tasks, and one spontaneous speech task. This particular configurationof sample data collection accommodates gathering of rich and well-balanced speech-samples across various speech types, andis expected to improve the utility of the speech corpus developed in this study. Samples from 639 individuals were collectedusing the protocol. Speech samples were collected also from other sources, for a combined total of samples from 1,012individuals.
신지영	The purpose of this paper is to report the whole process of developing Korean Standard Speech Database (KSS DB). This project is supported by SPO (Supreme Prosecutors’ Office) research grant for three years from 2014 to 2016. KSS DB is designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic and phonological studies and speaker recognition system. For the samples to represent the spoken Korean, sociolinguistic factors, such as region (9 regional dialects), age (5 age groups over 20) and gender (male and female) were considered. The goal of the project is to collect over 3,000 male and female speakers of nine regional dialects and five age groups employing direct and indirect methods. Speech samples of 3,191 speakers (2,829 speakers and 362 speakers using direct and indirect methods, respectively) are collected and databased. KSS DB designs to collect read and spontaneous speech samples from each speaker carrying out 5 speech tasks: three (pseudo-)spontaneous speech tasks (producing prolonged simple vowels, 28 blanked sentences and spontaneous talk) and two read speech tasks (reading 55 phonetically and phonologically rich sentences and reading three short passages). KSS DB includes a 16-bit, 44.1kHz speech waveform file and a orthographic file for each speech task.
신지영	This study aimed to investigate the correlation between speaker's chronological age (CA) and perceived age (PA) and to specify the effect of pitch and speech rate as acoustic cue on judging age, using perceptual testing and acoustic analysis. Three tasks were conducted to identify the degree of listener’s accuracy about age estimation. Three perception tasks were conducted to measure the accuracy of 80 Korean listeners when presented with different types of speech. In all the tasks, participants listened to speech samples and gave their estimate of the speaker’s age in figures. It was found that Korean listeners are able to gauge the age of a speaker fairly precisely. CA and mean PA were positively correlated in all three tasks. It is clear that the amount and type of information included in the voice samples affected the accuracy of a listener’s judgement. Moreover, the result revealed that listeners make use of acoustic information such as pitch and speech rate to estimate speaker’s age.
엄태웅	Recently, as the number of questions about the educational value and the efficiency of the conventional teaching methods is increasing, innovative teaching methods such as flipped learning, problem-based learning (PBL), self-directed learning are proposed as alternatives. These alternatives are key to refraining from the one-way method of teaching information to teach new knowledge to students in the classroom, and focusing on problem solving rather than knowledge transfer in the classroom.In this article, we have examined the commonalities and differences of recent innovative methods of education compared with classical and Chinese literature majors in the Department of Korean Language and Literature, Graduate School of Korea University. As a result, graduate school's teaching method showed problem solving tendency as innovative teaching method. There were also substantial differences. In addition to the curriculum, the postgraduate education takes the form of supporting a regular curriculum, with various seminars run by students autonomously, performing the functions of comparison and program.This shows two characteristics. First, graduate education has a complementary relationship between formal education and seminars. Second, while innovative teaching methods are fully led by professors, graduate education is led by students and is carried out in equal relationships without the hierarchical relationship between professors and students. Therefore, postgraduate education is beyond the innovative educational methods that are emerging recently.
오형엽	This writing wishes to analyze Kim Gwang-Gyoon’s poetry in a viewpointof ‘interrelationship of emotion and image’ and search it’s structural principle.Time of ‘high noon’ result link ‘dry emotion-modeling image’ association, timeof ‘evening’ result link ‘melancholie emotion-opacity image’ association appearsgreatly as ‘interrelationship of emotion and image’ In Kim Gwang-Gyoon’spoetry. Kim Gwang-Gyoon attempts first ‘dry emotion-modeling image’association, but ‘melancholie emotion-opacity image’ association has larger weightas this attempt is pulled down. Also, central image is converted by color imageof ‘dusk’ and ‘light-fog’ that is linked with time zone of ‘evening’ in fromfomations image of ‘modeling’ that is linked with time zone of ‘afternoon’.Structural principle in Kim Gwang-Gyoon’s poetry can be arranged tofollowing two foci related to aspect that ‘dry emotion-modeling image’ associationmoves as ‘melancholie emotion-opacity image’ association. As the first focusis dimension of poetic form, as opacity image appears after that modeling image'is pulled down, the border is removed and something that is equivocated haspersonality which is worth ‘negative description of real’. As second focus isdimension of poetic contents, dimension of main subject disclose in ‘speaker’semotion is solidified’ as ‘dry emotion’ vanishes and ‘melancholie emotion’ accounts for larger weight.If psychoanalysis’s ‘sublimation’ concept is linked with ‘melancholie’ concept,we can think that was put in conflicting relation mutually between ‘sublimation’that exalt target to dimension of noble thing and ‘melancholie’ that happenwhen it collapses and falls. To fill gap and blank between ‘sublimation’ and‘melancholie’ is ‘real’ as psychological reality be. The movement from the formerto the latter as correlation of ‘emotion-image’ by time that this article analyzescan be reinterpreted in process that ‘sublimation’ is changed as ‘melancholie’.We must keep in mind here that directivity of ‘sublimation’ has survived andmix in ‘melancholie’. In psychoanalysis’s concept, ‘light’ is involved with‘sublimation’, and ‘fog’ is involved with ‘melancholie’ that suffer whensublimation falls. Therefore ‘opacity image’ that ‘light’ and ‘fog’ are combinedcan understand by conjoiner of sublimation and melancholie. If say more correctly,we can understand as ‘melancholie that sublimation is deposited’.
오형엽	This writing wishes to analyze discourse structure of ‘crossover convergence antithesis’ of Kim Soo-young’s poetry focusing on ‘aesthetic effect and function’ and investigates ‘structurizing principle’. The most representative discourse structure of ‘variation’ is ‘antithesis’ in Kim Soo-young’s poetry. ‘Antithesis’ is used to similar concept with ‘parallelism’, method that repeats equal surface structure by each unit but is inserted new component in the structure. ‘Parallel antithesis’, ‘round-trip antithesis’, ‘chain antithesis’ appears frequently in Kim Soo-young’s poetry. And ‘crossover convergence antithesis’ is very important antithesis in Kim Soo-young’s poetry. We can find ‘crossover convergence antithesis’ on “The Thinking about the Room”, “Petal 2”, “Grass” in Kim Soo-young’s poetry.“The Thinking about the Room” show discourse structure of ‘chain antithesis’ and ‘crossover convergence antithesis’ that is spreaded by A(1 stanza)-B(2 stanza)-C(3 stanza)-D(4 stanza)-E(5 stanza). This poem is connecting A, B, C by the chain antithesis, and show that both poles is presented to A and B crosses and converges mutually in C. “Petal 2” show discourse structure of ‘parallel antithesis’ and ‘crossover convergence antithesis’ that is spreaded by A(1 stanza)-B(2 stanza)-C(3 stanza)-D(4 stanza)-E(5 stanza). “Yellow flower” that it contain ‘disturbance’, ‘accidental’, ‘other time’ offers force that recovers ‘freedom’, ‘being’, ‘truth’ as original state of ‘flower’ again. D intercross and converges between both poles through discourse structure of ‘crossover convergence antithesis’. “Grass” show discourse structure of ‘gradation antithesis’ and ‘crossover convergence antithesis’ that is spreaded by A(1 stanza)-B(2 stanza)-C(3 stanza). ‘Crossover convergence antithesis’ appears laying stress on C in A-B-C’s process of development in this poem. Subjecthood of ‘grass’ and post-subjecthood of ‘wind’ are intercrossing and converging in here.
오형엽	This writing tried to analyze “Snow”, “Waterfall” “Speech”, “Petal 1”, “Grass” laying stress on rhythm of ‘repetition’ and ‘variation’ equivalent to so-called Kim, Soo-Young’s nonsense-poetry, and investigate structural principle of Kim, Soo-Yung’s poetry. This writing investigates technique of ‘repetition’ and ‘variation’ in viewpoint of rhythm structure in Kim, Soo-Young’s poetry, wished to attempt new lighting about poetry consciousness related to timememoryunconscious.“Snow”(1956)’s central rhythm structure is movement of ‘falling’ of “snow”. The whole structure of this poem is achieved by ‘repetition’ and ‘variation’ of three sentences, “snows are alive”, “The young poet!”, “Let’s cough”. The discovery that “falling” snows “is alive” yet contain awakening for bigger vital force which ‘falling’ is the same as death but dynamism of the movement overcomes death. The repetition of sentence “The young poet!” “Let’s cough” is sympathetic signal that react in awakening that “falling” snows “is alive” yet. “Waterfall”(1957)’s central rhythm structure is movement of ‘falling’ of “waterfall”. That movement of ‘falling’ have contradictory two attributes to meaning of death that is bursting and meaning of vital force that is dynamic movement. “Stright” hints honest sprit and upright conscience overcoming “laziness” and “stability”. “Without” and “not” contains meaning of non-provision, non-intention, unconsciousness as well as no pear courage, sleepless durability, infinity of width and height that is contain.“Speech”(1964.11.16)’s central rhythm structure is movement of that see ‘sink’ of “root of a tree”. The whole structure of this poem is achieved by cause of 1 line “Root of a tree was falling for little more the depth winter” and sequences since 2 lines “Now my body is not my body”. On the other hand, “falling” and “is not my body” is looked like access to “eath”, but it is access of a little more original “life” and movement that is prepares for larger bearing fruit. the sentence “Now my body is not my body” declaration that is intent which leave in hands own to ‘other world’s force’, and will depart narrow outline of egotism with circulation of self-consciousness. “Petal 1”(1967.5.2)’s central rhythm structure is movement of “wind” ‘falling’ of “petal”. “Wind” that is ‘other world’s force’ offer power to “Petal” that falls in egotism of subject. “Wind” is ‘other world’s force’ intervening to “petal”, it is force of post-subject to burn that do not recognize own. “Unaware” confirm ‘post-subject’ and ‘unconsciousness’ of this wind. “Rock” is the same as solid actual darkness that “petal” wishes to zap ‘dynamism’, ‘life force’ that dropping petal has are that have force that can crumple rock. “Gat” is expressed thing with “revolution” that force of “petal” has broken all fixed value and identity following.“Grass”(1968.5.29)’s central rhythm structure is movement of “wind”. “lie down” and “get up”, ‘weep’ and “laugh” are not concept of opposition, are concept of dynamic transition. “Wind” is other world’s forces that secede from center of awareness and individual main chain self, and “grass” gets power of dynamism from this potential energy of post-subject. “Wind” is involved with ‘unconsciousness of post-subject’. “Grass” is acquiring one space naturally because is been a work that produce at seat that have pushed bipolar agreement with whole body in process that dialectic of ‘vanguard’, ‘stop’ is spreaded by ‘awareness of historical element’, ‘signal merit speed’, ‘satire’, ‘deliverance’, and internalizes within work unlike works that way of such poem differs following and is smelted in language structure.
오형엽	This writing wishes to analyze discourse and structural principle in Kim Soo-young’s poetry focusing on it’s function and role. This writing divide discourse structure of Kim Soo-young’s poetry 'repetition' and 'variation' greatly, and classify 'repetition' as 'recurrence of word', 'recurrence of phrase․clause', 'recurrence of sentence', and classify 'variation' as 'parallel-contrast antithesis', 'chain-gradation antithesis', 'round trip-gradation antithesis'.The basicest rhythm structure of Kim Soo-young’s poetry is 'repetition'. 'Repetition' means that equal word․phrase․clause․sentence are repeated. 'Repetition' is used to same concept with 'recurrence' here. ‘Recurrence of word’, ‘recurrence of phrase․clause’, ‘recurrence of sentence’ appears frequently in Kim Soo-young’s poetry. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry we can find 'recurrence of word' on “The Tomb of a Butterfly”. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry we can find 'recurrence of phrase․clause' on “The Prisoner Comrade Come Back to His Country”. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry we can find 'recurrence of sentence' on “Pride of the Day”.The most representative discourse structure of 'variation' is 'antithesis' in Kim Soo-young’s poetry. 'Antithesis' is used to similar concept with 'parallelism', method that repeats equal surface structure by each unit but is inserted new component in the structure. 'Parallel-contrast antithesis', 'chain-gradation antithesis', 'round trip-gradation antithesis' appears frequently in Kim Soo-young’s poetry. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry we can find 'parallel-contrast antithesis' on “On the Side of Onion Patch”. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry we can find 'chain-gradation antithesis' on “A Spring Night”. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry and we can find 'round trip-gradation antithesis' on “Snow”.

오형엽	This study attempts to interpret the contrast and harmony of the image, the affect and dynamics of the subject, derivation of motifs that occupies the core of Park Nam-soo’s early poetry, while at the same time illuminating the aura of ‘night’ as aesthetic back. The purpose of this study is to clarify the aesthetics of Park Nam-soo’s poetry as a characteristic of oriental modernism or Korean imagism which is different from western modernism or intellectual imagism. The overall characteristics of Park Nam-soo’s early poetry can be summarized as ‘poetic multi-depiction and motif derivation’ and ‘combination of static and dynamic’.Park Nam-soo’s the first anthology in his early poetry “Lantern” shows a poetic depiction of multiple arrangements of elements such as contrast and harmony of visual images and auditory images, the affect and dynamics of the subject, and shows the aura of ‘night’ as aesthetic back. The second anthology “Seagull Drawings” is a collection of motifs such as ‘wind’, ‘seagull’ and ‘flower’ while converging these various elements into one image. The first anthology forms the surface structure as biblical composition of loneliness affect to be created by the arrangement of visual and auditory images and mobility of the subject. In the inner structure, ‘the night’ is located as an aesthetic back which generates these phenomena.‘Night’ does not mean simply the temporal background, but it is a fundamental area that embodies and generates visual images and auditory image, loneliness and mobility of the subject, aura of despair and sorrow as a certain aesthetic base of the background encompassing time and space. Can be. ‘Night’ as an aesthetic back is an important foundation for securing the distinctiveness of ‘Eastern modernism’ or ‘Korean imagism’ distinguished from Western modernism and imagism.The second anthology shows the tendency to motivate and convergs to one image the elements such as the contrast and harmony of the visual images and auditory images, the loneliness affect of the poetic subject, and the motility to overcome them which were the aesthetic characteristics of the first anthology. The motif of the ‘seagull’ which was derived from the motif of the previous poetic elements and gathering together from the ‘wind’ to the poetic subject is derived a motif of ‘flower’.Despite these transformations, the aesthetics that form the common denominator of the first anthology and the second anthology can be found in the part where the contradictory collision between the key images that symbolize the poetic subject, such as the ‘quiet’ and ‘shake’ of the ‘lantern’, the ‘splashing’ the purity of the ‘seagull’, the purity of the ‘solid’ and the ‘dying’ ‘burning’ of the ‘flower’. This aesthetics of early poetry can be called ‘contradictory combination of static and dynamic’.
오형엽	This study attempts to explain a new interpretation of the ‘pure’ of ‘bird’ in the middle period of Park Nam-soo’ poetry, and to clarify the Korean imagism by illuminating the aura of ‘night’ as aesthetic back.The key motif of Park Nam-soo’ poetry in the middle period is ‘bird’. The meaning of ‘pure’ of ‘bird’ in “bird 1” is reality of pure nature in the first half, but absolute of pure nature ideas in the latter half. The development of the thesis of the work escalates into the dimension of the conceptual metaphor of the latter half in the dimension of the instantaneous imitation of the first half, and attempts a contradictory combination.“The Garbage of God” sets tension relationship on the absolute reality of pure nature and the absolute idea of ​​pure nature as a dual composition of the earth and the heaven. Looking at the poetic development process centering on the directionality of Park Nam-soo’ poetry, if the early poetry maintains a ‘horizontal composition’, middle period which can be called ‘the combination of physics and metaphysics’ moves to ‘vertical composition’.The fourth anthology “A dark funeral of Bird” is a continuation of the third anthology that leaps from reality of pure nature to the absolute idea of ​​pure, expands poetic imagination to the world of ‘motherhood’ and ‘abyss’ of the material through the motif of ‘night’ or ‘darkness’. The ‘night’ or ‘darkness’ appearing in “Morning Image 1” and “Night 1” is the ‘erosive motherhood’ of the material, and also has an ambivalent status of ‘tanatosian abyss’.

오형엽	This article seeks an approach to semantic structure by examining the poetry of Lee Yeon-ju from the perspectives of subject, motif, and allegory.If there is a pattern at the core of the “surface-level triple allegory” in Lee Yeon-ju’s poetry, and disease and death are generated as core motifs, then it is a process of transitioning to a “deep triple allegory” through the internalization of the poetic subject In addition to the motifs of time and the work of treatment through therapy. In this process of internalization, the poetic subject identifies the illness of the Virgin with himself and attempts to return it to external reality through treatment, thereby making the entirety of modern capitalist civilization an object of a “cultural doctrine” of “reality.” The motif of time in the process of transition from surface-level triple allegory to deep triple allegory associates individual existence and the unconscious with a dystopian future, whereas the motif of treatment is associated with religious mysticism. The image in which the motif of time and the motif of treatment are combined in one body is the space of the West and future time. Therefore, the motifs of illness and death present in the surface allegory in Lee Yeon-ju’s poetry are transformed into deep allegory through images of Westernization, the unconscious, dystopia, and mysticism, all of which are entangled like Mobius strips.This results in the scapegoat, the core of the deep triple allegory, that is, the motifs of atonement and salvation. This dimension extends the notions of disease and healing after identifying the sin of humanity with the poet’s own sins, with redemption coming through the scapegoat ritual and thereby making the entire human being, body and soul, an object of salvation. This is a cultural doctrine of ideological dimensions.

오형엽	This article focuses on ‘eyes’ and ‘memory’ in poetic methods, ‘memory/oblivion’ ‘rise/fall’ ‘open/close’ ‘flow/stop’ in poetic orientation, ‘death-love-solitude’ in motif, on ‘l-you’ ‘l-father’ ‘l-mother’ in subject’s relationship, ‘mother of two layers’ ‘ambivalence of chose’ in consciousness mechanism, ‘passive synthesis of time’ in time consciousness. This article will attempt to derive the structuring principles of Choi Seung-ja’s poems by attempting both macroscopic and microscopic exploration. Through this, I would like to shed light on the continuity and differentiation of the first and later poems, the poetic characteristics of each period, and the in-depth characteristics of individual poems.In the poems of Choi Seung-ja, the way of ‘eyes’ and ‘memory’, ‘rumination and prophecy’ act not only as the structuring principle of the later poems, but also related to the structuring principles that influence the continuity and differentiation of the preceding and latter poems. It is also intimately in touch with the underlying structuring principles of the individual works of the poem.The poems of Choi Seung-ja reveals the unconscious that seeks the liberation of dual oppression, suggesting the theme of ‘fighting with a violent father’ and ‘escape from a herding mother.’ The dynamics of ‘mother as jail’ and ‘escape from mother’ can explain Choi Seung-ja’s psychological mechanism as ‘ambivalence of chose’, provide the key to that ‘sublimation’ as a way of approaching the lost place.The temporality of the past and the future of Choi Seung-ja’s poems is shaped by the intertwining and winding of the two structuring principles of rumination and prophecy as a cyclic spiral movement. Choi Seung-ja’s poems show ‘question of time’ as poetic consciousness and ‘rumination and prophecy’ as structuring principle. And the phases of ‘past’ and ‘future’ are respectively referred to as the second passive synthesis of time and the third passive synthesis of time mentioned by Gilles Deleuze.

이상우	The drama <Kyu-han(규한)>(1917), which was written by Yi Kwang-soo, has be known that it is the first creative drama in Korea, the beginning of it’s creation is not late from the point of view in the history of Korean modern literature, or the history of Korean modern theatre. If we assume that Korean modern dramas(Shin-geki, 新劇) were established in colonial Korea in 1920’s, Yi Kwang-soo’s writing of drama <Kyu-han(규한)> was never too late at that time. However, it is difficult to understand that Yi Kwang-soo wrote a modern drama at its highlight period of Shinpa-geki(신파극) in colonial Korea. Not only that, after writing <Kyu-han(규한)>, Cho Cheon-seok’s drama <Jochun-yi-biae(조춘의 비애)>(1918), Choi Seung-man’s drama <Hwang-hon(황혼)>(1919), and Yoo Ji-young’s drama <Yisang-jeok-Gyolhon(이상적 결혼)>(1919~20) were continually published in the late 1910’s. How can we see this happening that modern dramas were continuously published in Shinpa-geki period of colonial Korea.This thesis is focussed that Korean students studying abroad in Tokyo mainly wrote these Korean modern dramas at that time, most of them were belonged to Korean students association of studying abroad in Tokyo, and their students association performed theatre by themselves on their year-end party. Especially, <Hwang-hon(황혼)>(1919) was performed on the year-end party of Korean students association. Therefore, we can suppose that Korean modern dramas which were created by Korean students studying abroad in Tokyo in 1910’s were born in accordance with the culture movement of Korean students association of studying abroad in Tokyo. Their choice of writing drama was the because that the genre of drama is the most effective for propagating nationalism and enlightenment than the other genre of literature, the other arts.
이상우	Yoon Shim-deok is famous for the first Korean soprano. While studying abroad at Tokyo music school, she participated in Keukyesulhyeophoe(the Theatre Institute) in 1920, which was a theatre troupe of college students studying abroad in Japan. As Yoon took part in Keukyesulhyeophoe's homeland performing tour in Colonial Korea in 1920, she never participated in the performance of theatre, but just sang in vocal recital. She couldn't be a 'humble'(lowly) actress as a 'new woman', because becoming an actress was regarded as 'the corruption' at that time in Colonial Korea.After the graduation of college, Yoon became the first soprano in Colonial Korea in 1923. She received an enthusiastic welcome on her first performance in Colonial Korea. However, some intellectuals attacked her arrogant manner to the spectators. They called her "tomboy". Nevertheless, Yoon was treated as a 'Queen of Musical Society', and a female celebrity of Colonial Korea, because she had the image of a pioneering new woman, who developed a new world of musical society.However, a scandal with a millionaire struck a fatal blow to Yoon in 1924. The scandal gave a prostitute's image to her. She then had no choice but to change from a soprano to an actress. She joined in Toweolhoe in 1925. She performed a heroine in Dongdo(Way down East), and Carmen in 1926. However, Yoon already lost self-confidence on the stage. She even trembled all over with fear on the stage, although she was once a 'Queen of Musical Society'. The cold smile, the catcall, and the blame from the whole society seemed to give stage fright to her.Because the internal conflict occurred in Toweolhoe, it temporarily broke up. With some intellectuals who were willing to build 'new theatre', Yoon prepared a performance of A Doll's House, and was appointed as the role of 'Nora' in 1926. However, she couldn't make the performance. Finally Yoon committed suicide by jumping out of a ship with her lover, Kim Woojin, who was a married man and a famous playwright in August, 1926. However, social opinion with the curse criticized their suicide at that time. It was the most famous scandal in colonial Korea.At that time, female celebrities also attracted public attention as like actress. However, if a certain female celebrity turned out to be involved in a scandal, her status also suddenly fell from the honor. Yoon’s case clearly suggests to us that there was a large difference between a 'honorable' celebrity and a 'humble' (lowly) actress in Colonial Korea. The question of whether a woman is considered as a 'honorable' celebrity, or a 'humble' (lowly) actress, can be answered in terms of the gender politics of modern nation state which was firmly constructed by male leaders. The nature of gender politics in modern nation state is based on the ideology of 'good wife and wise mother'. Therefore, when a certain female celebrity violated this ideology, she would also be the object of blame and hypercriticism.In conclusion, in order to understand the status of the actress in colonial Korea, we should realize that the issues involving actresses are tightly related with the status of theatre itself, the social status of women, and the nature of gender politics in the modern nation state.
이상우	In 1910's, Colonial Korean Youth were intensely attracted by the idea and literature of Tolstoy, who was a famous Russian thinker and novelist. Especially, they were seriously affected by Tolstoy's novel 『Resurrection』, or Katyusha, who was the heroine of 『Resurrection』. This thesis focus on the problems witch Tolstoyism came in Colonial Korea in 1910's through Colonial Korea tour of Geijutsuza's play <Hukkatsu>(復活; Resurrection), and it spreaded to people widely. Through those process, especially the theme song <Katyushano Uta>(カチューシャの唄; Katyusha's Song) gained popularity with 'Tolstoyan', who some Korean youth were attracted by the idea and literature of Tolstoy.The theatre company Geijutsuza, a playwright Shimamura Hogetsu led, made two times tour in Colonial Korea in 1915 and 1917. Geijutsuza's first tour caused influence Yeseongza's play <Katyusha>(1916), and it's second tour aroused Towolhoe's play <Katyusha>(1923). However, Colonial Korean theatre company members of at that time could not accepted Geijutsuza's spirit for Shingeki(新劇; modern drama), just imitated the popularity of Geijutsuza's melodrama <Hukkatu>. That was limitation that accepting Japanese Tolstoyism of Colonial Korea's theatre company members in 1910's and 1920's.

이상우	The purpose of this thesis is to study the relation between a Korean playwright Yoo Chi-jin's theatrical activity in Rikkyo university's student age(1926-1929) and same period's the trend of Japanese leftist theatrical world. When Yoo Chi-jin studied English literature at Rikkyo university in the late 1920's, he was a lot of interested in the theatrical arts the reason of why he was extremely impressed by Romain Rolland's a book "People's Theater". After reading this book, he was influenced by a Japanese famous anarchist Otsuki Sakae(大杉榮)'s anarchist thought.And then, he became a member of Japanese theatre companies of progressive type. First of all, he engaged in a theatre company of college students in Tokyo, Gindai-gekijo(近代劇場) in 1928. As he participated in some performance as a actor in Gindai-gekijo, he was affected by Russian avant-garde theatre, especially a Russian theatre director Meyerhold's theatricalism. At that time, Meyerhold method was received with wild enthusiasm in Japanese leftist theatrical world. Even if it was a amateur theatre company, it was biased in Meyerhold's theatrical method and Russian progressive plays.After withdraw from Gindai-gekijo, he took part in a professional anarchist theatre company, Kaiho-gekijo(解劇放場). This was the most representative anarchist theatre company in Japan at this time. As working as a actor in Kaiho-gekijo, Yoo was influenced by Russian revolutionary theatre, especially Russian theatricalism method, as like 'living newspaper play', 'blue(working) dress play', 'suitcase play', and so on. He came back Japanese colonial Korea, he became the most representative theatre critic in 1930's. By reflecting these experience of Kaiho-gekijo, he wrote several theatre criticisms which argued to develop Russian revolutionary theatre method in Japanese colonial Korea in the early 1930's.
이상우	Yoo chi-jin is the most representative playwright, theatre director, and theatre critic who had worked from 1930's to 1970's in Korea. Especially, he was a theatre critic who the most actively wrote theatre criticisms in the Japanese colonial period. In this research, I especially focus two items, the first is how he established his the early criticism in 1930's, and the second is what is the characteristic of Yoo's the early criticism, furthermore what is the essence of Yoo's early criticism in the same period.Originally, he wanted to be a poet, but his hope turned to be a playwright after witness the massacre against Korean people as the Kanto great earthquake came about around Tokyo area in 1923. When he was a student of Rikkyo University in Tokyo, he read Romain Rolland's book "the theatre of people"(1903), translated by Otsuki Sakae. After that time, he was interested in anarchism and radical theatre movement. So, he was Japanese anarchist theatre company's member, he participated in activity of performance. Through these activity, he began to take an interest in a famous Russian director Meyerhold and his theatricalism.According to deteriorate the political, social condition, it was impossible to pursue discourse of radical theatre, the aspects of his theatre criticism in the late 1930's modified from the early criticism. At this time, he pursued the theory of theatre's popularization, this theory emphasized the importance of the national(original) play, grand theater, and audience in the theatre. This, that is the emphasis of the national(original) play, grand theater, and audience, was not the fundamental change of his theory, but a mere external change. The nature of his theatre criticism was still lasted until the late 1930's.
이상우	The actresses were recognized the same as the gisaeng(Korean geisha) and the prostitutes, and were disdained in the East Asian society of pre-modern age. The recognition and idea about actress was established together with the formation of modernity in the early 20th century, but the tradition and recognition of disdaining a actress still remained largely unchanged at that time. There were onnagatas who male actors acted female characters in the pre-modern Japan and Korea, but according to be accepted the recognition about modern drama, suddenly denied onnagata, and a tendency to replace onnagata with actress appeared. In colonial Korea, onnagata in the 1910's gradually began to substitute for actress in the 1920's. It opened the real modern actress' age by the theatre company Towolhoe. Including Yi Wolhwa, who is to be rated as the first modern actress in the colonial Korea, Bok Hyesook, Yoon Shimdeok and others are actresses of Towolhoe. However, modern actresses of Towolhoe should got on their acting life in pain while fighting against the contempt and prejudice to actress who had been in existence since pre-modern age. Due to the fact that they were actresses, they had to become the heroine of many scandals. These prejudice against theater and negative perception of actress are unionized with universal gender recognition of a nation state, and a society.
이상우	According to outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the Japanese ColonialKorea was to be entered into fascist system of wartime. As a result, colonial Koreaplays in the late 1930s were indulged in difficulty by an enhanced control andcensorship. As It was getting more difficult to discover the proper motifs in realismplays, playwrights found a new space of representation, which was just historicalplay. From the late 1930s until 1945, theatre companies competitively performedhistorical plays , which were enthusiastic enjoyed by the audience. The most loyaltyof the audience looked at the repertoires of historical plays about ancient historyincluding the story of Silla. The next loyalty looked at the repertoires of historicalplays about of 'Yi Dynasty', which represented the story of Chosun era. However,the interesting point in here is the followings that historical plays about ancient historydepicted generally positive nation narrative. On the other hand, historical plays aboutYi Dynasty usually depicted negative nation narrative.In historical plays about tale of ancient history, <the Pagoda of Muyoung(무영탑)>,<the Bell of Emille(어밀레종)>, <Prince Ho-dong(왕자 호동)> are especially notable.These works generally represented proud nation narratives, such as the inspiringstory of completing brilliant art works, and the proud story of expanding nation'sterritories through defeating the foreign enemy. Historical plays about tale of ancienthistory were implied the nostalgia about nation narrative of the past, and this pointwas the reason of appealing for the audience to national sentiment. Interestingly,all three works constructed China as the other against the proud nation narrative.These was associated with contemporary context as the outbreak of the Sino-JapaneseWar, but also was associated with Japanese Oriental Studies's discourse which hopeto positioning Japan as the center of New East Asian Order through the otherizingChina.The notable historical plays about Yi Dynasty were especially <the Tale ofChunhyang(춘향전)>, <Donghakdang(동학당)>, <Satgat Kim(김삿갓)>. Especially, JangHyuk-ju's <the Tale of Chunhyang>, which was performed by Japanese theatrecompany Shinkyo in Japanese, exaggeratingly expressed Chosun society's corruptionthan the another versions of <the Tale of Chunhyang> at that time. The performanceof <the Tale of Chunhyang> in Japan combined the contents of Kabuki, and anJapanese actress performed the role of a hero 'Yi Mong-yong', so <the Tale ofChunhyang> was more feminized by these trials. <Donghakdang> stood out Chosun'syangban class and corrupt official's tyranny and greed to emphasize the legitimacyof Donghak revolution. <Satgat Kim> emphasized that Yi Dynasty's the inevitabledecline was natural.In this point, not only playwright's the voluntary recognition has somewhat alsoimplied, but also it was be influenced by the Imperial Japanese the discourse waywhich ancient Korean history was splendid, Yi Dynasty's history was declined. Thiswas also part of the discourse of Oriental Studies of the Imperial Japanese.
이영제	This paper aims to analyze syntactically about so-called double-subject construction. After dividing the double-subject construction into several categories according to the semantic relationship, the criteria for determining the subject were applied to each type to confirm the subject. The criteria for determining the subject are as follows. First, the argument structure of the predicate was given the highest priority as for determining the subject. Second, I tried to minimize the application of the topic construction, which is a discourse component, and to explain the syntactic composition of the syntactic level. Third, when the discrimination is difficult due to the ambiguity of the argument structure, the asymmetry of the relationship between syntactic compostions in relativization is used as a verification mechanism as a means of directly confirming the grammatical relation between the subject and the predicate. In this paper, I tried to use the grammatical relation between the predicate and other component in the relative clause as a criterion to judge whether or not it is subject.
이영제	The purpose of this paper is to report the application of Flipped Learning method to the curriculum of Korean Grammar and to examine in detail how this teaching method has an effect on enhancing learners' morphological and syntactic learning ability. The features and advantages and disadvantages of Korean morphology and syntax based on flipped learning can be summarized in five major points.First, learners mostly participate actively in cooperative learning discussion, and learners have a lot of expectations and passions about their own discussion learning. However, in order to have a proper effect, the number of learners and the scope of contents should be appropriately adjusted. Second, the competence and effort of the teacher is important, and the attitudes and preparations of the learners are also important. It is necessary to make a goal for each level by matching the goal progress, learning goals, and learning contents, and organizing a team for each level of learners. Third, if there are too many students and the level difference among students is large, cooperative learning is not done well, and the control of teachers is also limited. Fourth, it is necessary to minimize the video running time so that the burden on the learner does not increase. Fifth, it is also necessary to provide a variety of topics and contents for students to be interested in exploring topics for debating collaborative learning.
이영제	The purpose of this paper is to show the educational contents that can help Korean language learners' motives for grammar learning by applying the characteristics of Korean Wave contents to Korean grammar education. In addition, this paper intends to suggest an teaching contents that can help to strengthen the motivation of grammar learning among Korean language learners as foreign language. The previous studies mostly aimed to educate Korean culture based on the contents of songs, films or dramas, and had limitations in pursuing integrated cultural and functional education including listening and speaking. This could not lead to interest in grammar education and could not need to teach grammar.In this paper, we collected and processed contents that could be useful for teaching and learning Korean grammar for applying to the beginning of the lesson. In order to apply media such as Korean Wave contents to Korean grammar education, it is necessary to collect relevant contents suitable for the educational process, unlike cultural education or functional education. This study aims to show that the processed data can be applied to the areas of pronunciation education, word and sentence education, meaning and discourse education. The use of Korean Wave contents media materials will help learners to increase their motivation to learn and to maintain the duration and level of learning Korean. Understanding grammar content not only enhances students' ability to use Korean and advances to higher level learning, but also contributes to improving logical thinking and creativity of learners.
이형대	The purpose of this study is to determine the lives of widows who lived in the modern enlightenment period through literature style, poetry and medium of newspaper, newspaper articles. That is, it was tried to comprehend the lives of widows during this period more generally and objectively by approaching two aspects of literary form and medium recognition.In the aspect of poetic symbol, the works in the series of enlightenment lyrics and the works in the series of lyrics depicting women’s lives were analyzed. In the former works, they sang fundamental sorrows as the isolated existences and loneliness of widows who lost their identity as well as the loss of their husbands in the pre-modern family order. The historical time zone already stepped over the threshold of the modern era, but their lives stayed in the pre-modern era and kept daily lives which internalized the chastity ideology in the Confucian regulations and conventions.Otherwise, in the works in the series of enlightenment lyrics, it was made an issue of objective reality around widows as the social existences in relation to the widow’s own existence and the reality of society at that time ceaselessly. Furthermore, it was exposed the reality of society which threatened the lives of widows and showed the aspect to participate in the public ideal to realize the modern normal family and to materialize the modern nation-state as the main agents. In other words, they were a kind of modern planners as well as existences to open time of the future. In this respect, the forms of widow in the modern enlightenment period would appear the multiple and intersectional lives of synchronism of asynchronism which lives of several different time zones were mixed up.The lives of widows in the pre-modern era were overshadowed by the private area all the time, but it could be revealed to the public vividly due to the form of modern public sphere of medium of news paper. The difficult realities of widows who endured extortion of property or physical violence in the outside of the safety zone that was the legal protection of the independent country were observed by examining the articles related to widows. And it was confirmed the appearance as the main agents who participated in the public area and possessed the public interests in difficult situations such as economic exploitation and infringement upon personal rights.If it would be considered that the news paper articles which reported the news of widows who had to live in the non- simultaneous time zone honestly to related to the function of modern public sphere, it is regarded that it had positive significance in the aspect of discursive effect. For the public who participate in the public sphere could understand the reality of lives of widows related to their own situations on the basis of ‘sensus communis’ as the members of the community and recognize as the equal main agents of the public sphere. In the long view, it is considered those functions of the public sphere would contribute to reject the divided and redundant lives of widows and widow discourse gradually.
이형대	This essay aims to re-think the enlightenment period poetry, which finally accommodated public sphere away from convention of genre. In the context of historical semantics, this research closely examine inner consciousness of people of the time furthermore, this approach might authorize the enlightenment period poetry with meaning of language revolution as the emergence of the Modern.Methodologically this paper makes a development with conceptual history analysis. As in generally known, the poetry of the enlightenment period embodies many concepts which predict the emergence of the modern. What this essay tries to point out is that many concepts which people of that time described are not what they really experienced. In this reason their songs are transcendental dimension.Even though there is a gap between experiential space and horizon of expectation, people of the enlightenment era keep express their wishes for the future through the poetry. They convinced the progress of history, and their songs of anticipation made a change ultimately. In this perspective, this essay argues that the enlightenment period poetry is a song for the future.

이형대	This paper aims to examine the canonizing features of Korean poems and songs in the history of literature between South and North Korea since the division system was established. Description of literary history is a main device for inventing and registering canon. This history of literature was born in company with appearance of modern nation-state. A factor which has the greatest force among the external factors of canon formation is nation ideology and this canon would disseminate through the public education system. In this respect, literary works described in the history of literature between South and North Korea could have a modern conception of canonicity from 1948, in which the division system was formed as disparate governments were established in South and North Korea, to the late 1950 when the division system was entrenched.This paper firstly focuses on aspects that how nation ideologies of South and North Korea were viewed in the description of literary history. Different viewpoints on nationalistic and materialistic conception of history compose different contexts of canon in terms of genre, style and poetry works; and different lists of canon in Joseon Dynasty. Furthermore, this paper analyzes these canonizing features based on not only genre but pieces of works. The subject genres of this analysis are Sijo, Sasul-Sijo, and Gasa.In short, the main description of this paper is to investigate ideology of canon and authenticity of canon formation with Sijo, Sasul-Sijo, and Gasa according to time-based cross-section of the history of literature between South and North Korea at the time of establishing division system.
이형대	This study attempts to shed new light in regards to comicality in Saseol-sijo while focusing on the human body. While it is true that there have been many advances on studies related to comicality in Saseol-sijo, there is still much to explore on fields of the unknown. Because the materialization of comicality depends on historical and cultural situations as well as the genre of literature, the subject must be approached from multiple aspects.As one of the ways to approach this subject, I have selected to analyse comic subjects, while paying attention to physical symbols. In particular, the interrelationship between the body and mind, the correlation between the human body and objects, and a detailed analysis by dividing motives into transformation and disguise. The results showed that comic subjects were composed of the following aspects; first, satirical mocking; Second, humorous jokes; and third, complex comedy.There are a number of varieties of laughter, and the comedy can be manifested differently depending on how it is received, and the subjective mentality of its viewers. In conclusion, there is not only a need for the systematization of the macroscopic structure of comicality when explaining comicality in Saseol-sijo, but also for diverse research on unknown conditions of text, reactions of views, other aspects.
이형대	This paper is a type of discussion intended to explain some aspects of sensory experience as they appear in Sasul-sijo. Some areas of particular interest in this paper are as follows: First, this paper examines the peculiarity of the sense expressions presented in Sasul-sijo-through a comparative analysis of Pyung-sijo, which were written during the Joseon Dynasty.Second, we studied the patterns of sensory experiences in Sasul-sijo. The sensual and emotional expressions in Sasul-sijo are displayed in a variety of ways, depending on the inclination of the poet.Third, we looked at the question of how the poetic imagery of Sasul-sijo interacts with poets’ sensibilities and levels of devotion during the process of creation.Finally, we considered the poetic significance of Sasul-sijo, focusing on sensory experiences. It is understood that the sensory experiences of Sasul-sijo are meaningful, as they present specific_realities and personalities that are representative of everyday life. At the same time, they raise questions about traditionally accepted rules of discipline.
이형대	This article was written with the aim of reviewing works in a time-series way by classical poetry associated with the exchange of civilizations between East and West through the Silk Road.The first chapter of the text highlighted the significant dance of Cheoyong-ga's "Cheoyong-ga" and the Choyongran-manghaesajo tale, accepting the view that Cheoyong is an Islamic sea explorer. The relationship between this and the masks from the Central Asian region, described in the best-in-class <Daemyun> and <Sogdog>, was sought.In Chapter 2, I analyzed the life of Hoehoe-Aby, a work of <Ssanghwajeum> produced in the late Goryeo period, when the formation of the world empire of the Yuan Dynasty and its ruling power operated equally. In addition, research results were reviewed that examined the creation of a similar type of <Ssanghwajeum> through a series of original plays in cultural negotiations with the Silk Road from the beginning. Finally, the incense burner came to Goryeo, where it combined with indigenous beliefs and assimilated into our culture.In Chapter 3, we looked at <Hami Uighur>, which deals with foreign experiences Sung Hyun met in Beijing, and <Sora Country> among Lee Yu-won, who sings the culture of the West with only literature information, at a time when the negotiation of civilization through the Silk Road and the closed Confucian ideology of Joseon were impossible to directly interact with each other under operation The conclusion was completed by a cursory summary of the above discussion.

This article focuses on ‘Bare Life’ figures from social critical lyrics of the late Joseon between 18th-19th Century. First part of this study demonstrates that ‘Live Politics’ which arose from Western political context has how different foundation from confucian political tradition of the East. After this analysis, this research found that characteristic of the late Joseon political power system. From this features of the period, this paper argues that social critical lyrics also frequently contains ‘bare life’ figures.

For the research, drewing a conclusion after analyzing current status and problem of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in order, and founding out that development level of Korean Studies also same order and latter has more problems to be improved.To promote Korean Studies in this area, equal and mutual benefit perspective required based on the Post-colonialism solidarity. Also, national level of integrated management system is necessary for the effective management. Additionally constructing a total information system is essential to induce multiple supports. Universities should give some preference to younger scholars from the Tricontinental countries, and develop culturally suitable educational material also urgently needed.
이형대	This article focuses on analysis of the migrants figuration and aims to explore its significance on Korean poetry from 18th century to the early 20th century in an aspect of poetic justice.First part of this study by particularly analyzing <Imgyetan>, <Kapminga>, and <Puksaegok> among premodern social critical lyrics and more closely examine the figuration of the migrants. These three works commonly describe horrors of the migrants in the result of the tyrannical politics and large scale natural disaster with realistic viewpoint. Authors of above pieces urge the recovery of the benevolent government as a solution of migrant issues.In the next place, focusing on the migrant poetries which extensively produced in the result of land plundering and deliverly. These poetries vividly describe the sorrow of Korean diaspora, people who unavoidably should leave the country after the failure of nation state construction, and Japanese colonization.The migrants are repressed and excluded beings from the nation and society as well. In this reason, poetic justice from the migrant poetries is a chance to reevaluate the required values in public life by empathizing and sympathizing suffered others. This resonance makes the significance of reading a classical Korean poetry for today.
장경준	The purpose of this study is to clarify versions of Daemyengryul-Jikhae and to summarize bibliographic characteristics and to select the fine print of each editions.The different versions of Daemyengryul-Jikhae are classified into two types according to a period of original script(底本). One is ‘Sejong thirteen-year revised version’ and the other is ‘after Sejong thirteen-year revised version’. The former is classified into one edition and the latter is classified into five editions which are Gongju edition(estimated), Gwangju edition, Jinju edition, Nagan edition and Pyeongyang edition.First, Sejong thirteen-year revised version is different from the other version in view of original script. And this version is also distinguished from material characteristics. There are two prints of this version. And the print possessed at Hosa’s collection of books is the fine print.Second, Gongju edition(estimated) was based on ‘after Sejong thirteen-year revised version’ and was published in Gongju. This edition had been become a model of other editions afterwards. There are two prints of this edition and the print possessed at Naegak’s collection of books is the fine print.Third, Gwangju edition was published in Gwangju and Naju area. Many errors were occurred in process of engraving. There are six prints of this edition. And the prints possessed at Yonsei University, Tongmungwan, Kyujanggak are the fine prints.Fourth, Jinju edition was engraved in Jinju in the late 17th century. A part of contents of volume 12 were substituted with Daemyengryul-Ganghae and an additional article was inserted in volume 13. There are three prints of this edition. The prints possessed at Mansong’s collection of books, Gyeongsang University, Catholic University of Daegu are the fine prints.Fifth, Nagan edition was engraved in Jeonju in the late 17th century and printed in Nagan. The correction and occurrence of errors were co-occurred in process of engraving. There are eight prints of this edition and some of them have an additional article inserted in volume 28. The print possessed at Seokjeon’s collection of books is the fine print.Sixth, Pyeongyang edition was published in Pyeongyang in 1686 and propagated widely. This edition have many errors in comparison with others. There are five prints of this edition. And the prints possessed at Kyujanggak, Chungnam University are the fine prints.
장경준	Daemyeongryul-Jikhae(大明律直解) is an Idu(吏讀)-translated version of The Great Ming Code(大明律) adapted for circumstances of the Joseon Dynasty. There are only versions of the reprinted editions that are estimated to be printed after the 16th century now. Since they show delicate differences, it is necessary to examine them for classifying types and rectify texts for establishing the standard text.This study, at first, examined versions possessed at Korea University Library and Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies(奎章閣). We reconfirmed descriptions in the literature about the material bibliographical characteristics of them. On the other hand, we could correct disagreements and wrong details in the literature by the detailed investigation. Next, we rectified texts of the versions from the textual bibliographical view and presented the putative standard text. This helped with the type classification of ambiguous versions.It has been claimed that the different versions of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae in Korea are able to be classified into two types. The investigation, however, revealed that the Mansong-B version which has been classified as Pyeongyang type and the Korea University version which was newly found may be recognized as a type, the intermediate type, from material and textual aspects, whereas Mansong type can be subdivided into the Mansong-A type and the Hongmungwan(弘文館) type.

장경준	This article gives a brief introduction and comments about the specific procedure and the writing guideline for a report of ongoing recension-correction work on Daemyeongryul-Jikhae. Although our guideline follows the guideline of Institute for the Translation of Korean Classics, it reflects the specificity of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae and is complemented by Corrected Daemyeongryul-Jikhae (校訂大明律直解) as a precedent. In particular, we included not only different versions representing six types of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae but also seven commentaries as the objects of recension to be able to check the changes in Daemyeongryul (大明律). We have also separated the recension and correction reports for easy analysis of the differences in texts. In addition, we standardized the sentence form of correction report by patterns for maintaining the consistency of reports. We will steadily modify and complement the recension-correction reports following the guideline, and the final result will be published as part of Korean version of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae in 2017.
장경준	This paper summarizes the characteristics of Daemyengryul-Jikhae at first, and reviews the previous translations of Daemyengryul-Jikhae, and briefly introduces the policies of new translation focusing on bibliography and Jikhae part of Daemyengryul-Jikhae.Daemyengryul-Jikhae is a book which is consist of two parts -the original text of Daemyengryul written in Chinese Characters and the translated text written in Idu transcription called Jikhae. The content of the original text differs depending on the versions. The Idu used in the text of Jikhae is not only the vocabulary form but also the grammatical forms such as particles and endings of words. Among the Chinese characters used in the text of Jikhae, there are many differences in the usage of the original text or of the the modern Korean language.It is difficult for the readers to understand the parts of inconsistency between the original texts and the text of Jikhae in the two previous translations. The translation of Ministry of Legislation can be found in the point of serving as a guide for researchers for a long time, and the translation of Pak Chul-ju provides detailed and precise translations. But the latter lacks basic understanding of bibliography and text composition, and although the two-stage translation of the paraphrase for other researchers has been presented, it has limitations such as difficulty in satisfying either one at the expert level, and also have inconsistency with the facts or excessive commentary.The new translation, which is scheduled to be published by the ITKC, records the results of the recension-correction works on 6 different versions of Daemyengryul-Jikhae. We translated both original and Jikhae texts as complete as possible, and edited both texts to match the original script as much as possible. We also tried to mark the Idu parts of the Jikhae text with a consistent principle, and made effort to translate the texts in accordance with the style and character of them.
장경준	In this paper the non-read characters, which means Chinese Characters not read by Kugyol reader’s translation into Korean, marked in Lotus Sutra of Beopeung’s collection are investigated. In this material, non-read marking character ‘不’ was used for vol. 1 and non-read marking line ‘∣’ was used for vol. 2 and 3. And they are never been found in any other material so far. The range of the non-read characters of this material is much wider than that, which has been set abstractly by Kugyol or Japanese Kunten researchers. It is assumed that this is mainly because the person who attached Kugyol in this material carefully compared the Chinese text with its Eonhae text and recorded the results. The existence of the non-read characters is of great significance, because the concept of non-read characters has been substantiated with concrete data for the first time, and we can also get many implications for study of the Eonhae text.
장경준	Seokdokkugyol of Koryo Dynasty is an essential heritage for studying Korean grammar before Hunminjeongeum(Korean script) of creation as a kind of translation in order to interpret classical Chinese grammar as Korean. For the purpose of studying Seokdokkugyol data in earnest, it is necessary to trace the Kugyol characters from which literature and how being often used for certain function. To survey it systematically, it is efficient to tag each Kugyol character and construct annotated corpus of Seokdokkugyol for computational processing. This paper illustrates constructing process of the first annotated corpus 'sktot_2013_07' and output. For this, 5 types of Seokdokkugyol text were compared and rectified and grammatical distributions of the whole Kugyol characters were recorded. This paper is expected to become one of primary data for accurate research of Seokdokkugyol.
장경준	In this paper, we examined the process of historical Korean language corpus and thought about the limitation of present corpus and future direction. In addition, I have looked at a corner of the process of the Korean lexical system change by examining how the "謗" of the original text has been disputed in various documents as an example of a study using an annotated data corpus arranged side by side with the original Chinese text and the unexamined text.As a way to improve the completeness of the constructed corpus, this paper proposes the following two. The first is to have a physical environment in which anyone who is interested in the document data can access it regardless of the place and the time, and can check the latest version of the corpus text and the high quality picture of the document which is used as the preview directly. The second is to create a system that easily informs the corpus when someone finds an error in the corpus created in the previous environment, corrects corpus after expert review of the collected information, and then periodically updates the corrected corpus. This system should include the release of documents included in the corpus, the retrieval of corpus, and the provision of statistical data.In the future, I hope that a detailed study of the kanji of the original Chinese text and the corresponding vocabulary corresponding to the Chinese text using the parallel corpus of the Korean-translated text will lead to a new chapter in the study of the Korean lexical history.
장경준	The Urimalsaem contains the historical information of about 5,000 lexical items. They are based on the materials as a part of the 21st Century Sejong Project, which has constructed from 2002.The historical information in the Urimalsaem, however, have several issues. The information is provided only in modern entries and is especially careless about semantic changes. In giving examples, the modern and archaic entries are asymmetric and one can find hardly semantic differences from the examples. The information about related words is not well-constructed and there are not a few cases that the historical information is not described well due to the exclusion of Old Korean materials from the reference.In order to resolve these issues, it is necessary to collect the corpora of historical materials maximally and to fine them for high-quality data. Also the corpora of historical materials need to be open so that users of the Urimalsaem can search and correct errors from them, correct and supplement the historical informations of lexical items furthermore.
장경준	<Daemyeongryul-Jikhae(大明律直解)> was first published in 1395, and is a Idu(吏讀)-translated version of <Daemyeongryul(大明律, The Great Ming Code)> adapted for circumstances of the Joseon Dynasty. This study examined the reprint possessed at Naikaku's collection of books(內閣文庫) and the reprint housed at Hosa's collection of books(蓬左文庫) in Japan, kept as microfilm in the National Library of Korea in Seoul, among a number of different reprints(異本) of <Daemyeongryul-Jikhae>.This study reconfirmed the existing research result, which is that the reprint possessed at Naikaku's collection of books(the following: Naikaku) is identical to the reprint housed at Mansong's collection of books of Korea University Library in Korea(晩松文庫). However, this study revealed that the reprint housed at Mansong's collection of books(the following: Mansong) has possibility to be later edition than the version of Naikaku and the edition housed at Hosa's collection of books(the following: Hosa) and the version of Mansong was separately bound as 4 volumes or 5 volumes in the bookbinding process. Besides, the sequence of table of contents contained in the version of ManSong is different and it had partly drop-out. Furthermore, it has a bare chance to be 'edition of Gwangju province in the 1550s'. Instead of that, there is great potential to be reprint published, which is revised edition in Gongju province in 1546 upon further review about catalog of Kosachalyo(攷事撮要).Although the printing style of Hosa version is irregular and imperfect on physical traits, otherwise the advanced research described it, it is better edition, which has less errors than the versions of the Naikaku and the Mansong. Therefore, it is newly proved that the version of Hosa can be utilized as important material to determine the corrected edition of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae.
장경준	Daminglu, the legal code of Ming dynasty, was established and promulgated in 1397 (Hongwu (洪武) 30). It had been revised a few times before the promulgation but now there are scarcely any materials that show the changes of legal code in Hongwu era, and the remaining books are mostly published in Joseon. A version of Daminglufuli (大明律附例) published in Joseon introduced the contents which have differences with the legal code of Hongwu 30 under the name of “Korean version (鄕本)”. We investigated the contents to find the books which have contents corresponding to Korean version, analyzed the relationship between the text of Korean version and the legal codes in Hongwu era, then briefly described the compilation and publishing of typical Korean versions.It turns out that Daemyeongryul-Jikhae and Daemyeongryul-Ganghae are the books corresponding to Korean version completely while Daminglu in possession of Gogyeong museum (古鏡博物館), Lujiebianyi (律解辯疑), and Lutiaoshuyi (律條疏議) have some contents of Korean version. According to our comparison and recension of Daminglu texts in progress, the books corresponding to Korean version can be roughly divided into three groups by the periods of reflected legal codes in Hongwu era. Group 1 reflects the legal code before Hongwu 18~19, group 2 reflects the legal code of Hongwu 22 or 18~19, and group 3 reflects the legal code of Hongwu 30.Daemyeongryul-Jikhae, the Idu (吏讀) translation of Daminglu, had been originally published in 1395 then intensively published in the mid-to-late 16th and late 17th centuries. It seems that Daemyeongryul-Ganghae, an annotated version of Daminglu, was compiled in Joseon. After publishing of the original version in King Sejong era, the version including enlarged annotations had been used until late 16th century but the original version came into wide use again after late 18th century. The continuing publishing of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae and Daemyeongryul-Ganghae through the Joseon dynasty shows not only that there had been huge demand for these books in practical fields applying Daminglu on a criminal case, but also it had close connection to the enforcement of gwageo (科擧).
장경준	Joseon has imported Daemyengryul from Ming Dynasty, translated it with Idu in 1395, and published of the name of Daemyengryul-Jikhae. Daemyengryul-Jikhae was republished several times. The Jungchuwon of the Government General of Joseon investigated the traditional laws of Joseon and requested to professor Hanamura Yosiki of Gyongsung Imperial University for comparing different versions of Daemyengryul-Jikhae and make corrections as needed. Consequently the 『Revised Edition of Daemyengryul-Jikhae』 was published in 1936.The contents of 『Revised Edition of Daemyengryul-Jikhae』 was reliable for the most part and was recognized as canonical version. However, there were some weak points that needed to be made up; when Hanamura compared the different versions he didn't do a good job with Takjokam Edition, it wasn’t the best decision to select Hongmunkwan Edition as a standard script of revised edition, and recensions and corrections were somewhat inadequate.In conclusion, 『Revised Edition of Daemyengryul-Jikhae』 leave much to be desired as canonical version, therefore, we are in need of new corrected edition of Daemyengryul- Jikhae.

전도현	This paper performed a statistical analysis of literature text published in Korean modern journal. A source book of this study is The survey and research of Literature Text on Korean Modern Journal(Seojungsihak). That contains list of literary works which appeared in national journal from 1906 until 1945. Concretely I analyzed the number of works classified according to period․genre․writer, component proportion ratio, and aspect of diachronic change. The results of the analysis is as follows.Literature text published in whole period of research object amounts to 50,939 works. The graph showing quantity variation is in the shape of steep mountains. And it peaked in the mid 1930s, especially in 1935 and 1936.In a quantity of literature text classified according to major genre, poetry is first, followed by essay, novel, literary criticism, play. And importance of modern poetry and novel increase highly since the first half of 1920s. In case of some subgenre, sijo(traditional three-verse Korean poem) and juvenile literature are in full flourish from the second half of 1920s to the first part of 1930s, whereas a translation shows high proportion in the second part of 1900s and the first half of 1920s.Meanwhile in whole period of research object, the entire writer who has published work in the Korean modern journal amounts to 11,285 persons. And if I make a guess active productive stratum of literary work based on the number of publishing work, it is estimated to around 1,000 persons. Diachronically the number of writer change suddenly in proportion to variation of the volume of literature, but average number of work per man is almost unchanged. When I analysis the number of writer by genre, the case of creating works in various genre almost amount to 3,000. This suggests that there are quite a few specialized writers who work in multiple genre.
정광	Both Laoqita and Piaotongshi were originally published as textbooks for teaching Haneryanyu (漢兒言語), the official language of the Yuan (元) Empire. Each of these textbooks, however, underwent several revision processes as the official language of China changed when a new dynasty came in to rule the empire. During the Ming (明) dynasty, each of them was published as Revised Version to accommodate its official language Nanjing Guanhua (南京官話) and then for the Qinɡ (淸) dynasty as New Annotated Version to suit the Beijing Mandarin. This version of Laoquita was also published as Reprinted Version for teaching standard Beijing Guanhua (北京官話).This paper makes claims concerning (1) the date of publication of the original Laoqita and Piaotongshi and (2) their authorship. We first claim that they were published almost the same time around the year of Bingxu (丙戌, 1346) during the period Zhizheng (至正) of Yuan. This claim is based on at least two passages in the texts, as follows: (1) Piaotongshi mentions in Lesson 39, entitled “The Goryeo Monk”, that Monk Boheo (步虛) of the Goryeo dynasty gave a sermon in the capital city of Yuan in the year of Bingxu (丙戌) and (2) in Story 105, entitled “Auspicious Day for Returning Home?” (筭卦), Laoqita also has a passage “May you have good fortune in this year of Bingxu (今年交大運丙 戌) that refers to the year of Bingxu (丙戌, 1346).The Original Laqoita also mentions about bǎochao (寶鈔), a paper money used during the Yuan dynasty, reflecting the market price of Zhizheng (至正, 1341-1367) period, especially that of 1355-1368. Second, we claim that both Laoqita and Piaotongshi were written by some official government translators/interpreters of the Goryeo dynasty who were dispatched to the captial city of Yuan and stayed around there for a good portion of time. This claim is simply based on frequent references to persons and affairs related to Goryeo in the texts.Both Laogits and Piaotougshi were, however, textbooks for reading Hanyǔ (漢語), complementing and closely related to each other with interesting contents. Since both of them were used as textbooks for reading Hanyǔ texts, the contents mostly focused on learning Hanyǔ with their main topics covering from the names of Chinese dishes, proverbs, and idiomatic expressions to the ways of finding directions to a hospital, selling and buying things for trade or other daily affairs that might easily occur while living in a foreign city. They were textbooks for learning Hanyǔ as a living language.Laogits and Piaotougshi each aimed at different levels of difficulty in learning Hanyǔ. Laoqita aimed at the elementary level, whereas Piaotongshi was written for the intermediate level. For those who were taking the highest-level state examination for recruiting official interpreters (譯科), for instance, Laoqita provided the material for practicing on primary tests. Piaotongshi, on the other hand, provided intermediate-level practice materials that required more specicialized skills. They were, however, both Hanyǔ (漢語) textbooks for understanding daily life.
정광	This is a study of the relation between Jade Book of Wolin-seokbo (月印釋譜, the Shining Moonlight and Buddha's genealogy) and Hunmin-jeongeum. The Jade Book was excavated in the 12th year of Zeng tong (=1447) in Buril Temple (佛日寺, Burilsa) near Kaeseong,North Korea. This was examined and authenticated by the author and by other experts of jade and various institutions.The study of this Jade Book led to the understanding of the names of the new letter, that is, the names created by King Sejong such as the correct sounds of Chinese characters(正音), the correct sounds for teaching people (訓民正音), and the vulgar script(諺文). The study also raised a possibility that a version of the Korean translation of Hunmin-jeongeum was attached to the old version of Wolin-seokbo.In other words, it is argued that the Hunmin-jeongeum added at the beginning pages of the old version of Wolin-seokbo, published in the 12th year of Zheng tong, is actually the Korean translation version of Hunmin-jeongeum(훈민정음 언해본). On this basis, the author claims that this is the actual occasion of the first promulgation of King Sejong's new script, Hangul.
정우봉	This thesis aim to examine to explain themes and expression mode of a cavalry’s Naliga which was written in Korean in the 18th century. And I was concerned about it’s status within diary literature in the late Chosun dynasty. Naliga was written by a cavalry which was affiliated in Hunryondogam(訓鍊都監). He saw active service in Lee In-jwa’s Rebellion(Musin Rebellion) as a cavalry. The cavalry lived in Seoul. And the cavalry as lower class people was poor and they leaded the hard life.He was concerned about expressing the satire on incompetent commanders and the praise on generous commanders. He powerfully expressed his position, opinion and emtion. And also he tried to express the cavalry’s hard day during the war. Naliga reflected collective emotion of lower class people including cavalry.Naliga made use of various literary techniques, for example irony, satire and apostrophic technique. Especially Naliga made the best use of irony. There was a note of irony in his voice. This work has been filled with lots of irony. Such characteristics reflects the emotion and consciousness of the cavalry who was the lower classes in Chosun dynasty. In this way Naliga has important meanings in diary literature in the Chosun dynasty. It has important significances in the 18th century.I believe that analyzing characteristics of Naliga can contribute to understanding the literature history of diaries in Chosun dynasty. Also, I expect that this kind of approaching could play a role in creating another methodology to analyze diaries as a branch of literature.
정우봉	In this paper, I explored and showcased travel journals covering Mt. Baekdu in the 18th century. So far, about 10 types of travel journals covering Mt. Baekduhave been reported. The paper uncovered three new documents that were unknown to the academic world. It is written by three people, Namely Sin Gwang-ha, Hong Jung-il, Kim Jo-won.Mt. Baedu was the vorder between Chosun dynasty and Qing dynasty. Mt. Baedu Demarcation of Stone was established in 1712. Hong Jung-il climbed Mt. Baedu in 1740. He was interested a border area of Chosun and Qing dynasty. He argured that the difference in the pronuciation of Tuman River. He instisted that Gando region can be included as Chosun's territory. The idea of Chosun's old territory recovery was expressed in this Baedusanilgi.Among them, the paper intensively analyzed the travel journals of Hong Jung-il. Before analyzing the travel journal to Mt. Baekdu, I studied the writer of Baekdusanilgi in detail. As a result the writer of Baekdusanilgi was turned out to be Hong Jung-il. These new material will greatly benefit from studies on Mt. Baekdu in the future.I believe that analyzing prototypes of wrting style in landscape essays can contribute to understanding the literature history of landscape essays in the late Chosun dynasty. Also, I expect that this kind of approaching could play a role in creating another methodology to analyze landscape essays.

Lately thirty two humanities scholars published in aseries about Korean studies and art paintings on Naver cast. The planningserialization had a wide range of readership and was published by apublishing company. And Korean classical literature text database can clearthe way for general readers to experience Korean traditional culture, whichhas accumulated over the long history. This database have to accumulatestandard and significant texts through the comparative and analyticalinvestigation.I suggested several ways for communication and popularization of Koreanclassical literature studies. Taking this opportunity I hope that popularizationof classical literature will be revitalized more and more.
정우봉	This thesis was focused on analyzing Kim Samuidang’s prose works. Kim Samuidang is a typical female artist of the late Joseon Dynasty. She has created a lot of poetry as well as prose works. By the 18th century, women writers have created a lot of poetry as well as prose works. Samuidang wrote a prose work up to 23 pieces. And she utilized a variety of prose genres. In particular, she actively utilized farewell prose(送序). Fawell prose is hard to find among woman writers.I overviewed Kim Samuidang’s prose works overall and analyzed the prose works. Samuidang’s prose works is divided into three. The first is the exact language of persuasion on the other side. Its contents are the ones that persuade or urge her husband and children. Through the orderly logic and the exact representation were discussed intensely self- assertion and opinion. Sometimes, she expressed the stylish and leisurely mood through the elaborate language.

정우봉	This paper was focused on explaining Yi Hyeon’s Toshinsahaeng(通信使行) and Recognition of Japan. He was born as a child by a concubine(庶孼). His career was not well known and his collection of works also was not known. Because of social status he had to go under the social discrimination. He didn’t do high ranking position due to physical restrictions. I recently found his collection of literary works. What draws attention from his collection of literary works is that it contains many articles related to Toshinsahaeng(通信使行).Yi Hyeon was a member of Tonsinsa(通信使), the envoy dispatched by the Joseon in 1711. He played various exchanges with Edo literati and scholar(for example Amenomori Hoshu and Arai Hakuseki) in academic cultural aspects.This paper was aimed at examining Japanese envoys and Yi Hyeon’s recognition of Japan. He did not think of Japan as a hostile country or a culturally inferior country. On the contrary, he grasped Japan from a mutually equal point of view. He emphasized the value of sincerity(誠信) in diplomatic relations between the two countries. This perception is very similar to Amenomori Hoshu’s the concept of sincerity(誠信).And he thought of Japan as a rich country. Behind that perception was a pragmatic and realistic attitude toward wealth. He showed a more rational and objective perception of reality.Active research about a child by a concubine(庶孼) literature and Tongsinsa in the 18th century is expected to be through this paper.

The characteristics of his diary was similar to letters. And he translated his diary into Hangeul characters for his mother and daughter. This translation in Sim No-sung was for family communication during exile. This diary writing was something special between Sim No-sung and his family.

Many intellectual recorded their diaries during the war. Yeheon’s Piranrok was a typical example among war journals. I tried to take view of the descriptive perspective and writing method in Yeheon’s Piranrok. First, sourceful introspection was distinct characteristic in the descriptive perspective. Yeheon penetrated into a chaotic state of affairs during Japanese invasions of Korea. And Yeheon had reflective consciousness about self-existence. He contemplated his existence through diary writing.I had a task to study the writing methods in Yeheon’s diary. One of the distinct characteristic in writing methods was to increase specific gravity of discussion. Yeheon advocated strongly his opinion and position about cause of war, war responsibility, morality, fortification and righteous army. Yeheon made the best use of communication method and catechetic method. He answered his own questions about the enter and retirement of public office. He expressed his worry and conflict through various techniques of expression.I have a task to study the diary in Chosun dynasty. I believe that analyzing characteristics of Yeheon’s diary can contribute to understanding the literature history of diaries in Chosun dynasty.

정우봉	Kawai Library, an attached library of the University of Kyoto, Japan, houses 820 kinds of old books and more than 3,200 ancient documents. This paper deals with the material values of Unofficial History Series Publication (野史叢書). There are three kinds of Unofficial History Series Publication, in other words Seolchong (說叢), Ajujablog (鵝洲 雜錄), Sodaesueon (昭代粹言). Seolchong (說叢) is a new material that is not listed elsewhere. The book is stamped with Baek Doo-yong (白斗鏞). Baek Doo-yong was a famous book trader and publisher in the early 20th century. He sold many books, and Japanese scholars bought books through him. You can see the situation of Korean old books exported to overseas.Ajujablog (鵝洲雜錄) has his own stamp. This Unofficial History Series Publication was copied by many people, and there are several versions. This made it difficult to estimate which text was close to the original. The information on the dojo in the book can help you to estimate the original. In this sense, Ajujablog (鵝洲雜錄)’s academic value in the Kawaii library is high. In addition, I looked at two kinds of writings, in other words Haedongjegapildam (海東諸家筆談) and Jingseonglog (懲省錄). I hope that more research will be done on the old books of Korea in the Kawaii library.

정우봉	The purpose of this study is to investigate auto chronology in late Joseon dynasty. Auto chronology is one of autobiographical literature. So far auto chronology has been neglected because it was generally thought as a dry form.I investigated auto chronology in Joseon dynasty widely. And I prepared a auto chronology list. This list is given in appendix. I had studied the characteristics of auto chronology. Also I had studied the change of auto chronology in late Joseon dynasty.I analyzed critical discourse involved in auto chronology. One of the characteristics of auto chronology was self-examination and internal confession. Sim No-sung and Lee Ki-won was representative writers such tendencies has been well expressed in their works. This tendency was strongly marked in late Joseon dynasty.Autobiographers has pursued a concreteness and integrity of everyday experience in late Joseon dynasty. Their works had been expressed true self-images. And method of organizing had been changed in writing style of auto chronology. New organization methods was different from arrange in the chronological order.
정우봉	This thesis was focused on explaining the aspects of acceptance of Chen ji-ru in the late Joseon dynasty. I was concerned about Chen Ji-ru’s books which had a big impact on society of intellectuals in Joseon dynasty. Chen ji-ru was a famous publisher in late Ming period. Joseon intellectuals read widely his books and was influenced by his books. Especially this thesis analyzed three books, namely Boksujeonseo(福壽全書), Manbojeonseo(萬寶全書) and Yeolgukji(列國志).The direction of the aspects of acceptance of Chen ji-ru may be summarized as follows.

정우봉	This study focused a discussion on regional recognition. How to embody the life and custom of Hamgyong province in custom and geography books? It is this study’s major point. Especially I discussed custum book written by Hangul in depth.Lee Gwangmyung’s Yijupoongsoktong(夷州風俗通) was Hangul prose writeen by Hamgyong province dialect and recorded minutely everyday life in Gabsan, Hamgyong province. Lee Gwangmyung used native language for vivid reappearance. Hangul prose writeen by dialect is very rare. In turn, Yijupoongsoktong was very important not only as Hangul prose but also as custom book written by dialect.I compared geography book written by Hamgyong province writer with geography book written by non Hamgyong province writer. Comparison objects was Kim Gihong’s Gwangokyaseung(寬谷野乘) and Bukgwanji(北關誌). Different eyes of native and stranger was refected on two books.
정우봉	This thesis was focused on the description of the literary history. Especially I dicussed the following issues, namely how to describe history of Korean literary criticism in classical Chinese. For this purpose, the paper tried to find new direction of description. It is divided into four aspects. Description of the mutual coexistence, the history of the notion of genre and the history of the concept of criticism is typical cases which to be dealt with important issue. The second is to study the history of the concept of genre in terms of the history of criticism. This approach is to introspect literary genre's inner nature. The third direction is to research the fundamental principles and nature of history of Korean literature. Lastly I checked topics not been studied so far in Korean criticism in classical Chinese.
최귀묵	The study comparatively investigated aspects of relationship between god and Buddha(神佛) shown on 『Samguk Yusa(三國遺事)』 and 『Shaseki-shu(沙石集)』. Two writings made in similar time have a character of Buddhist legendry in common. As both embody aspects of relationship between god and Buddha(神佛) colorfully, it would be appropriate to compare two books. The comparison results are as follows.In 『Samguk Yusa』, several types of relationship between god and Buddha(神佛) are embodied in Buddhist tales. In 『Shaseki-shu』, the theory of honji suijaku(本地垂迹說) is intensely expressed. In 『Samguk Yusa』, Buddha Bodhisattva and god are set as 'vertical' differential relation while god and Buddha(神佛) in 『Shaseki-shu』 live together in 'parallel' equal relation. All the beings in 『Samguk Yusa』 long for seeing real body(眞身) of Buddha Bodhisattva. In the 『Shaseki-shu』, all the beings feel more familiar to transformed body(化身) which is a god. God and Buddha(神佛) in 『Samguk Yusa』 appear mainly in transformed body(化身). God which is local manifestations(垂迹) in 『Shaseki-shu』 reveals, delivers an oracle, appears in dream. God and Buddha(神佛) in 『Samguk Yusa』 aims at 'negation and transcendence of the present world' but god and Buddha(神佛) in 『Shaseki-shu(沙石集)』 put importance on 'now and here' too.Type of relationship between god and Buddha(神佛) which can be identified in 『Shaseki-shu』 is found in China. It is thought that as Shinto(神道) in Japan and Taoism in China were deeply involved in establishment of relationship between god and Buddha(神佛), this happened. In the future, it is intended to expand scope of the study to whole East Asia including China and Vietnam.
최귀묵	This article examines the imagery of Yijeong and Nata in their father-son relationship as presented in episodes 12~14 of Bongsin Yeonui (封神演義, Fengshen Yanyi, Investiture of the Gods). Yijeong and Nata meet as father and son in two reincarnations. To differentiate these two father-son pairs, they shall be called ‘Yijeong1’ and ‘Nata1’ in ‘father-son relationship1’ and ‘Yijeong2’ and ‘Nata2’ in ‘father-son relationship2’.A qualitative leap occurred to Yijeong during the course of Yijeong1 becoming Yijeong2. The transition to Jijeong2 was not only a political decision, but also a religious decision to determine the denomination within Taoism. After his victory over Nata2 using the pagoda, Yijeong2 was able to guide Nata2 to use his power in a right direction without the aid of ascetics. Yijeong2 overcame his dread of Nata's power and could assume his responsibility the father for teaching the son appropriate behavior. Yijeong2 eventually became father.Nata experienced a qualitative leap as well. Yijeong2's guidance transformed him to a man longing for father's longings. The power of Nata2, which represents the providence (天意[heaven's will]) embodied as Muwang Beolju (武王伐紂, Wu Wang Fa Zhou, Crusade of King Wu against King Zhou), works in three dimensions: power realized in the human world, power realized in political justice, and power realized in historical development. Nata2 realized his political ideal alongside Yijeong2 and achieved religious deliverance, magnificently fulfilling his filial duty. Nata2 may thus be valued as a character who performed an ultimate filial piety by shedding a petty filial piety.Nata and Yijeong were completely transfigured after going through severe conflicts. Conflict accelerated maturation, and rivalry became synergy. They saved each other. The qualitative transformation in father-son relationship2 was the result of the total disruption of father-son relationship1. This transformation was expressed by the imagery of political alliance and religious camaraderie going far beyond a mere father-son relationship. This father-son imagery of horizontal fusion (cooperation and mutual complementation) of allies and comrades depicted in father-son relationship2, overcoming the vertical inequality of father-son relationship1, can be interpreted as a radical conclusion drawn in Bongsin Yeonui.
최귀묵	In this paper, I will look at the relationships between the process of creation and acceptance and the esthetic characteristics of the letters and waka(和歌) included in the Kagero Diary(蜻蛉日記; c. 974) of the Japanese Heian period (794–1185).The Kagero Diary was the product of a special type of marriage called tsumadoikon(妻問婚), in which the husband visits his wife instead of living with her. Waka were composed as a way of tying or uniting couples and helping maintain the marriage. The letters and waka exchanged between spouses were seen not only by themselves but also by others. The spouses were aware of this fact when they wrote and in the atmosphere of aristocratic society of the period, where people tried hard to avoid being subject to observation by others, the result for their writing was the use of understatement and refined expressions.Thus, the couples involved came up with self-recitation(獨詠), addressed to oneself and not one’s spouse, intended as a way of speaking their minds, instead of “singing under observation.” The Kagero Diary is a good example of the composition process of this exchange of thoughts(贈答) and self-recitation that shows the esthetic characteristics of this genre of literature.Exchange songs(贈答歌) and choruses(唱和歌), duets in this case, had limits because couples were not able to freely express their thoughts under their awareness that others were also watching. However, with short self-recitations, destined for oneself alone, psychological ups and downs, and deep sentiments could not be satisfactorily expressed. This resulted in the creation of a kind of prose something like that of a private novel(私小說). The more one’s inner thoughts underwent catharsis, the more the prose marginalized the waka.As the example of the Kagero Diary shows, Japanese literature in this period played a role of socialization consolidating camaraderie, one of the reasons why the Heian(平安) period saw it prosper. Apart from the socializing role it plays, its recreational role is another aspect that defines medieval Japanese literature.
최귀묵	This paper compared and reviewed the poetic theories and Chinese poems of the Korean author Kim Chang Heup and his Japanese counterpart, Kan Chazan. Kim Chang Heup and Kan Chazan shared largely the same opinions on poetry, and both rejected archaism. First, they did not just copy High Tang poetry. Instead, they focused on the (sometimes trivial) scenery right in front of them, and described the calm feelings evoked by what they had seen. They also adopted a sincere tone, instead of an exaggerated one, because both believed that poetry should be realistic.However the differences between the two poets are also noteworthy. Kim Chang Heup claimed that feelings and scenery meet each other within a literary work through Natural Law, and the linguistic expressions that mediate the two are philosophical in nature. However, Kan Chazan did not use Natural Law as a medium between feelings and scenery. Instead the Japanese writer said the ideal poetical composition comes from a close observation and detailed description of scenery. In sum, while Kim Chang Heup continued to express reason through scenery, Kan Chazan did not go further than depicting the scenery itself.In addition, Kim Chang Heup believed poetry was not only a representation of Natural Law, but also a high-level linguistic activity that conveys a poetic concern about national politics. As a sadaebu (scholar-gentry), he held literature in high esteem because he thought that literature could achieve important outcomes. On the other hand, Kan Chazan regarded it as a form of entertainment, thereby insisting literature had its own territory that is separate from that of philosophy or politics. In other words, whereas Kim Chang Heup considered literature as something close to a form of learning, Kan Chazan viewed it as art.One might wonder whether the poetics of Kim Chang Heup and Kan Chazan reflect their individual accomplishments, or if the characteristics of Chinese poetry that Korean and Japanese poets had long sought after had finally surfaced in these two writers. This paper argued that the two authors' poetics represent characteristics of Chinese poetry in Korea and Japan, or general characteristics of Korean and Japanese literatures in a wider sense. Their request to depict actual scenery in a unique way, free from the ideal model of literature, must have facilitated an outward materialization of Korean and Japanese literary characteristics that had developed over a long time.
최귀묵	In the Middle Ages, some Chinese Taoists and Japanese Shintoists envisaged that Shenxian or Kami(Shinto gods) went to India and appeared as Bodhisattva in order to edify people. In Laozi Huahujing, there is a mention of Laozi reforming the people in India and his disciple Yin Xi entering the womb of Queen Maya and being reborn as Gautama Buddha. In the Ming Dynasty Taoist novel, Fengshen Yanyi, there is a passage about three Taoist Shenxian who went to India and became Bodhisattvas. Meanwhile in Japan, Yoshida Kanetomo(1435-1511) compiled the theory of Shintoism which says that “god is the main body and Buddha is the avatar.” All three instances mentioned above have one idea in common that the indigenous deity is the main body and Bodhisattva is its incarnation. These instances can be collectively referred to as “God-main-Buddha-avatar-theory”. Discussion about the relation between Bodhisattva and indigenous deity is called “God-Buddha relation theory”. This theory asserts the superiority of the indigenous deity over Bodhisattva and can be said to be one of the “God-Buddha relation theories” showing the active response of indigenous faith against Buddhism.
최귀묵	Le Hữu Trac is known as the best doctor in Medieval Vietnam. Le Hữu Trac originally wanted to be a Confucian officer or a military strategist. However, after being afflicted by a disease, he decided to become a doctor. As he realized that the medical profession was a long and difficult one, he did not seek fame but explored the fundamentals of medicine to compile a monumental medical book of the history of Vietnamese medicine. Hải Thượng y tong tam linh is a comprehensive medical compilation that combined diverse medical books and reflected Le Hữu Trac’s clinical experience.Le Hữu Trac’s medical profession is grounded on Confucianism (theory of Yin and Yang). In Hải Thượng y tong tam linh, he sketches the fundamentals of medicine, compiles prescriptions, and describes the medical properties and usages of native Vietnamese ingredients. He also reports his travel to treat Trịnh Sam in Thượng kinh ky sự, which is the last part of Hải Thượng y tong tam linh.Thượng kinh ky sự includes many diagnoses and prescriptions, which can be considered good illustrations of the theoretical discussion in Hải Thượng y tong tam linh. When Le Hữu Trac describes the symptoms and treatment of people of high rank, he satirizes their indulgence in sensual pleasure or criticizes the stupidity of their dissipated lifestyle, which adversely affects health. Unlike other medical books, Thượng kinh ky sự contains Chinese poems and can thus be read as a work of poetry. As Thượng kinh ky sự is a travelogue, a medical book, a philosophical writing, as well as a work of talks on poetry, it can be evaluated as the product of Le Hữu Trac’s thoughts that encompassed and penetrated human body, mind, society, and nature.
최귀묵	This study examines the background and various aspects of the composition of love poetry written by Gozan monks(五山禪僧) in Japan, and critically reviews the theory of the composition of love poetry. Love poetry refers to poetry written by old monks to express affection(情) and love(思慕) toward beautiful boy(美少年) monks. Love poetry is deeply related to homosexuality in Zen temples.The following are the four most important points among the results of the discussion. First, love poetry is the result of an overall relaxation of discipline in Gozan Zen temples. Second, the love poetry of Gozan is a good example of a mixture of Chinese poetry and ethnic songs. “Love,” the core motif of Japanese poetry, penetrated into Chinese literature under the name of love poetry. Third, the distance between Zen(Buddhist) poetry and en-poetry was further than the distance between “relaxation(安心)” and “grief”(牢愁). Love poetry is inherently an expression of “agony.” Fourth, the popularity of love poetry was a break away that was difficult to justify according to Zen thought and poetic theory.
최귀묵	With the huge question of studying the history of Chinese literary translation in East Asia, this study examines the patterns and characteristics of the translation of the Classic of Poetry in Vietnam during the medieval era. Based on certain characteristics of the work, this study intends to reveal what perceptions and attitudes the Vietnamese had toward translation. The following are the findings of research into the patterns and characteristics of the translation of the Classic of Poetry.First, there were various styles of translation, such as the prose style and poetic style. The poetic style follows the form of ethnic poetry in various formalities. Second, the prose style delivers the meanings of the original work and adds expository references when needed. The original work is often abstracted when translated in the prose style, and reorganized to have new poetic form. Contents not in the original work are added at times when needed. Third, whether it is the prose or poetic style, the translation is based on the annotations of The Collection of Classic of Poetry. In Vietnam, Zhu Xi(朱熹)’s annotations were the standard in understanding the Classic of Poetry. Fourth, the poetic style allows translators to reorganize the original work, rather than be bound by it, so it can become an almost new creation different from the original work. By narrowing the distance between translation and creation, a good translation was considered a wonderful creation.Translation in Vietnam raises the theoretical question of what “translation” means. Vietnam’s example clearly shows that translation does not lie far from creation. The discussion’s conclusions can be summarized in one sentence: “In Vietnam, a translated text (poetic-style translated text) is acknowledged as a ‘work,’ the product of creation itself.”
최귀묵	Japanese renku renga (聯句連歌) and Vietnamese hat noi were poetry genres popular during the Middle Ages that merged stylistic elements, specifically prosodic elements from classical chinese verse (漢詩句) into the native verses. In the context of East Asian literary history, the adoption of prosodic elements (number of syllables, tones, and rhymes) from Chinese poem is a distinctive commonality of these two genres. On the basis of this fact, the present paper aims to examine the manner in which the merging of these native forms and Chinese characteristics took place, the role of Chinese poetry in both indigenous poetry genres, and the characteristics of the literary history of Japan and Vietnam that are respectively reflected in each genre.The findings of this study can be summarized as follows. While Japanese renku renga and Vietnamese hat noi both absorbed Chinese prosodic elements, there is a clear difference between the two in the combination of rhythms across languages, in that in the Chinese–Japanese collaborative verses (漢和聯句) that were part of renku renga, Japanese verses (和句) rhymed with Chinese verses while in hat noi Vietnamese verses (越句) rhymed with a Chinese verse placed in between the two Vietnamese verses.The Chinese verses carried much weight for the unfolding poetic concepts in both poetry genres. Renku renga used associations (聯想) from authentic precedents (典故) of Chinese literature (漢文學) while hat noi focused uniquely on the meaning of Chinese verse (詩意) in the composition of. In both genres, merging Chinese prosodic elements into native poetry appears to have heightened the style (格) of the poem and to have added to the ‘pleasure’of composition and appreciation.The two genres have a particular formality in their combinations of Chinese verses with Japanese verses or Vietnamese verses, and demand a high level of knowledge of Chinese literature to compose and appreciate them; thus, the poets in these genres and their readers were limited to literary people of the upper classes. Also, the two genres appear to have attempted to achieve literature’s function of ‘distinction’ within their respective indigenous poetries.Both Japanese renku renga and Vietnamese hat noi emphasized literature's function of entertainment and fellowship. In particular, Chinese–Japanese collaborative verse (漢和聯句) was an intellectual game.
최귀묵	This study concerns Ryokan(良寬, 1758~1831), a Buddhist priest-poet(詩僧) who lived during Japan’s Edo Period, and is written with the purpose of examining the particularities of his poetic texts that surfaced as a result of his choosing religious mendicancy(托鉢) as a way of living. The conclusions from the discussions can be summarized as follows. First, in order to consistently elucidate Ryokan’s literary universe, and to define its unique characteristics, we need to particularly focus on the fact that Ryokan was a mendicant Buddhist priest(托鉢僧). Second, we may generally classify Ryokan’s literary universe into works that describe the pleasure(興) of living freely in the mountains(山中閑居), and works that describe the pleasure(興) of free associations(無礙行). [The enjoyment one feels when one does not discriminate between the high and low classes, young and old ages(上下老少), and socializes with peasants or children.] Third, while we may consider the works that describe the pleasure of living freely in the mountains as a continuation of traditional priest-poet literature even as they show a salient theme of loneliness, we find that works that describe the pleasure of free association are unique to Ryokan. Fourth, we should re-evaluate these works that describe the pleasure of free association not only in the perspective of Japanese literary history but in the perspective of East Asian priest-poet literary history.Ryokan’s literary universe is exceptional because it includes works that describe an elevated(高雅) enjoyment that comes from meditating and living alone apart from not only secular society but also the religious community of the temples, as well as works that describe the enjoyment that is felt in socializing with peasants and children, who may be called the general public, or all living beings. In particular, Ryokan called the life lived in community with the general public as a temple offering(布施), and poetically presented the enjoyment that comes from being with the general public. Thus Ryokan may be credited with reviving a thematic current that was deep-flowing beneath East Asian Buddhism, and he may also be credited with presenting a type of enjoyment that is not commonly found in the poetic texts of priest-poets. In this aspect we find the reasons by which to recognize that Ryokan’s literary achievements are unique and eminent, and thus occupy a prominent place in not only Japanese but also East Asian priest-poet literary history.
최귀묵	In this text, the author examines the aspects and characteristics of the three forms that were created and enjoyed when the upper-class nobles of Japan “combined(混淆)” waka(和歌) and Chinese poetry(漢詩) between the 10th and 17th centuries. The three forms are the “Collection of Japanese and Chinese poems for singing”(和漢朗詠), “A collection of Japanese and Chinese poems”(詩歌合), and the “Renku renga”(聯句連歌). “Collection of Japanese and Chinese poems for singing” appeared in the 10th century, “A collection of Japanese and Chinese poems” appeared in the 12th century, “Renku renga” appeared in the 14th century, and all three continued to influence the history of Japanese literature after that time.As the combination of literary Japanese and Chinese progressed, the gap between waka and Chinese poetry decreased until they finally combined to create a single work. That is, waka and Chinese poetry converged in one place in multiple ways: as a work that was appropriate to be recited(“Collection of Japanese and Chinese poems for singing”), facing each other work against work in a competition(“A collection of Japanese and Chinese poems”), and, in the end, they reached the point where they were interchangeable as lines making up long poems(長詩)(“Renku renga”). The combination of literary Japanese and Chinese can be said to be the Japanese version of the common movement in East Asian literary history during the Middle Ages to make songs from one’s own language flawless in Chinese poetry.Meanwhile, by examining the status changes that appeared as Chinese poetry paralleled, fought with, replaced, and combined with waka, we can find clues to explain the attitudes of the Japanese people on Chinese poetry during the period when the three forms existed, as well as the characteristics of Japanese Chinese poetry that appeared in response to that. The preferences not of “myself” but of the “audience,” content and expressions that revere the period rather than the inner self of the poet, and the fact that it is a means for enjoyable pleasure rather than having the original characteristics of lyrical poetry for self-expression are all characteristics of Chinese poetry in Japan during the early and late Middle Ages period. These characteristics can be said to be the current that flows in the underbelly of the history of Chinese literature in Japan. This author believes that the key to discussing the history of Chinese literature in Japan during the Middle Ages period from the perspective of East Asian literary history can be found here.
최동호	Born in 1921, Paek, Seok reached 100th anniversary, however, the overall characteristics of his literature are still needed to be unfolded. The existing researches are focused on his firs poem book Sasum(Deer, 1936) and fairy poem book Jipgene Ne Hyongje(Four Brothers of the Hermit Crabs, 1957) published in North Korea. At the Loyola library in Sogang University, I was able to find his translated novel Tess listed in chronological list but not been confirmed. This paper is meaningful as the first research article on this novel. With this novel, Korean literature in 1940s could extend its prospect and space. In the ear of suppression and pro-Japanese literature, Paek, Seok deepend his literature and showed more matured literary world exceeding his first poem book while wandering around Manchurian area. Paek, Seok's translation of Tess is significant in that it is the first full-scale translation of foreign full-length novel and that his unique sense of language is shining through it. To investigate this, this paper comparatively examined three translations; adapted story Beonlong by Kim, Gi-jin, complete translation by Chung, Chong-hwa and Paek, Seok's translation. The comparison of three translations proved that Paek, Seok translation has most excellent literary sense. He probably perceived his destiny after a wandering life in Manchuria through this translation. It also served as a momentum for his literature to be matured. With the research on Silent Don, a direct translation of the major work of modern Russian literature from original text after Tess, a translation of the representative work of modern English literature, Paek, Seok's literature will become widely known to the general public. Therefore, this basic research is absolutely necessary to overcome intellectual trend of going into the narrow territory of data and making fence or blindly following the critical logic of foreign country. To construct such basic foundation will be the shortcut for deepening uniqueness of Korean literature and making independent research possible. It is expected that subsequent generations develop this basic research into continuous and creative one.
최호철	The aim of this study is an analysis of conversation textbooks published in the beginning of the 20th century for Korean learners of Japanese in terms of content and presentation style. To this end, seven textbooks have been selected that focus on the conversation among the books published at that time. I researched how the criteria of the textbook units is arranged, the presentation of the dialogue, the way the authors mark the speakers of the dialogue, and whether or not they have translations and phonetic value of dialogue in Japanese. In addition, I researched the change of overall content and presentation style over time. In conclusion, the features of conversation textbooks for Korean learners of Japanese have changed over time. At first, most textbooks were organized by subjects and situations such as daily life, personal relationships and friendships, nature, jobs, and business. Next, the textbooks began to include practical dialogues relating to daily life, friendships, and jobs at the beginning, but the subjects they dealt with were shifted towards business contexts and abstract concepts. After the year 1910 when colonization over Korean was full-fledged, content for teachers and civil servants was fortified and policemen textbooks were published. Thirdly, sentences for practicing conversation were presented as dialogue or isolated sentences; mixed forms of sentences also appeared in the same units. When dialogues were used they cannot be completed in terms of meaning. Fourthly, even though their focuses are conversation, five textbooks do not have the title of the speakers. Five textbooks present sentences marked with numbers.One textbook presented sentences without any marks. Fifthly, all textbooks presented Korean sentences with a Japanese translation, and only one book includes phonetic value. Finally, Six textbooks have a vocabulary section that comprise of semantic parts with dialogue. Among them, five textbooks present vocabulary by subject, such as daily life, interpersonal and social relations and business related words. These words strongly reflected situations of those times.
최호철	The purpose of this study is to explain the grammaticality and logicality of the sentence utterance “Mun dadgo deul-eowa(Close the door and come in).”, often mentioned as an expression that its inner-structure is non-grammatical and its semantic connection is illogical. Even though previous researches have made an attempt to add a new function of ‘go(and)’, this study suggests a new analysis focusing on the meaning length of the following verb. “Mun dadgo deul-eowa.” can be interpreted in the two possible ways: in both ways, the speaker’s reference point is the inside of the room, one is that the listener is at the outside of the door, and the other is that the listener is at the inside of the door. First of all, when listener is at the outside of the door, from the inside of the room to the outside of the door will be the meaning length of ‘deul-eo-oda’, and this utterance does not work since the listener cannot come in after closing the door. Second, when the listener is at the inside of the door, from the inside of the room to the inside of the door will be the meaning length of ‘deul-eo-oda’. In this case, the sentence utterance “Mun dadgo deul-eowa.” makes a sense. That is, the listener can come in after closing the door. Therefore, “Mun dadgo deul-eowa.” is a grammatical and logical utterance, which can be accepted in the situation that speaker’s reference point is the inside the room and listener is at the inside of the door. It seems that “Mun dadgo deul-eowa.” could not be accepted generally under the assumption that the utterance is made when the speaker’s reference point is the inside of the room and listener is at the outside of the door.
최호철	This paper aims at revealing and distinguishing types of sentence meanings and the synonymous relation of them. First of all, types of sentence meanings are divided into locutionary meaning and uttered meaning, and each can be subdivided into designative meaning and interpretative meaning. Based on these classifications, six synonymous constructions that can mean typical [POSSESSION] in the dimension of locutionary meaning are illustrated and analyzed. In this process, it is verified that the meanings of sentences are not to have a homogeneous value in equivalent levels, but to have various kinds of semantic properties in different levels. Given the types of sentence by meaning, there are two kinds of sentential synonymous relation; between meaning-designating sentences or between meaning-interpreted sentences. Actually, six constructions that denote [POSSESSION] are synonymous in a level of meaning-interpreted sentence, not meaning-designating sentence.
최호철	This paper describes the necessity of metaphor database construction and discusses the nature of metaphor database and how to construct it. The metaphorical database is a large-scale database of metaphoric expressions. The metaphor database collects a wide variety of language expressions containing metaphorical thinking. The collected metaphor expresses the source area and the target area first, sets a keyword that covers the subject area and the source area covering the target area, and presents the examples and the sources of the metaphor expression in actual use. The metaphor database thus constructed is not only a base for understanding the expression of Korean metaphor, but also a production data that can express metaphors. At the educational level, it can be used both as comprehension and metaphor for Korean metaphor.
최호철	The goal of this research is to study the principles of lexical education for learners of Korean for Academic Purpose(KAP) and to develop their vocabulary learning textbook. The method of teaching vocabulary has received the most attention since the lexical competence form the basic foundation in carrying out academic activities. Without the knowledge about underlying vocabulary of learners’ major, it is impossible to perform tasks of the diverse classes they take in their university. According to preceding researches some lists of vocabulary was drawn only for the specific major or irrelevantly for the general, and there was discussion whether these words were academic or not. Focusing on the importance of academic vocabulary, this article tried to settle the concept of academic vocabulary and find out its characteristic features. Furthermore for the academic vocabulary textbook such rules were considered as follows. At first, academic vocabulary should play a basic role in depicting academic text rationally and objectively. And these words should be presented in academic context also, even if advanced learners rarely encounter. Besides even basic vocabulary for beginning level include academic text, so various lexical meaning relations should be considered in developing textbook. Finally, as mere repetitive exposure to words leads to failure in acquisition of the pragmatic function. the tasks should offer chance to improve self-directed learning ability.
최호철	In present day Korean, while it is described as misusage of meaning that lexeme ‘teullida’ might be used as having the sense <daleuda>, it is considered as extension of meaning that lexeme ‘gamsahada’ might be used as having the sense <gomabda>. This research analyzed the examples of lexemes ‘gamsahada’ and ‘gomabda’ in order to make a judgement of validity about assigning the meaning <gomabda> to lexeme ‘gamsahada’. A result of analysis of examples is as follows. The meaning of lexeme ‘gomabda’ is defined as <be admirable in speaker’s opinion> based on the construction ‘geosigiga gomabda’, and describes an attribute of subject ‘geosigi(=people or things)’. The meaning of lexeme ‘gamsahada’ is defined as <would like to give a reward from the heart of speaker> based on the construction ‘amugaega gamsahada’, and describes a mental state of subject ‘amugae(=people)’. ‘gomabda’ and ‘gamsahada’ have differences in subject and contents of predication, therefore these are distinct lexemes. Then it requires further reconsiderations that the meaning <gomabda> is assigned to the lexeme ‘gamsahada’ and that lexemes ‘gomabda’ and ‘gamsahada’ are synonymy.

최호철	The syntactic category description of ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) is currently divided into four types in the Korean dictionary, where only as adjectives, adjectives and intransitive verbs, adjectives and transitive verbs, or adjectives, intransitive verbs and transitive verbs. As such, the syntactic category description of ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) shows a consistency for adjective category setting, but it does not show a consistency for verb category setting, so this article discussed the syntactic category of ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful).The key to the semantic qualities that distinguish verbs and adjectives is whether they persist, change or act over time. If the continuation, change, or action over time in the meaning of a predicate is perceived or recognized, it has a verbal meaning, otherwise it has an adjective meaning. Thus, if a predicate has a verbal meaning, it will have a verbal characteristic in terms of morphology and syntax, and if a predicate has an adjective meaning, it will have an adjective characteristic in terms of morphology and syntax.The adjective ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) is an immediate and instant response that appears in the mind of the speaker by an external stimulus. To say that the response is immediate and instant means that the external stimulus is also immediate and instant. In other words, the external stimulus that causes the adjective ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) cannot be sequential or continuous and its response cannot be sequential or continuous.The adjective meaning of ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) is an immediate and instantaneous reaction that occurs in the mind of the speaker as the resultant state of a particular time, so in that sense it is not possible to recognize the change or duration of the microscopic passage of time. Therefore, the meaning of the resultant state, which is the adjective meaning characteristic of ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful), cannot be changed into the meaning of the continuation or change, which is the verb characteristic, and consequently setting the syntactic category of the verb (intransitive verb, transitive verb) for the predicate ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) will have to be reconsidered.The phenomena of using ‘Gamsahada’(be thankful) as a verb in place of ‘Gamsahaehada’(to thank) in everyday language life can be considered similar to the case where ‘Teullida’(not right) is incorrectly used in place of ‘Dareuda’(not the same) in terms of the semantic sense.
최호철	The meaning of the text utterance(=discourse) is the addition of speech-act meaning to the meaning of the locutionary text, which is the addition of binding meaning to the locution words, phrases, or sentences which comprise the locutionary text.Since those meanings of locutionary words/phrases/sentences which excluded binding meaning are literal(or word for word) meanings of locution, the meaning of locutionary text was analyzed based on literal and binding meaning of locution and speech-act meaning was analyzed based on the attitude(background, intention) of the speaker/listener, the relation(status, age, familiarity) of the speaker/listener and speech scene(time, location, situation) and speech deixis.Text utterance(=discourse) analyzed in this paper is from an essay which has the title of ‘Knights on the Table’, mostly recall of the past where speech scenes of the past(1~13 and 29~33) were expressed in situations of those days. In other words, the two parts(1~13 & 29~33) could be said as the locutionary utterances of the past and speech-act meaning of the whole text utterances(=discourses) was revealed under the current speech scenes and the speech-act meaning of the two parts(1~13 & 29~33) was revealed under the locution of recall of the past. Therefore, the speech-act meaning of the whole text utterance(=discourse) and the two parts(1~13 & 29~33) were revealed separately and the speech-act meaning of each part(1~13 vs. 29~33) was also revealed separately since two parts are scenes from each different past.
홍종선	The {-o} ending of the ‘hao’ speech style has gone through numerous diachronic changes. The honorific level has been lowered and there has been a functional differentiation between the original form ‘-o/so’ and its phonological variation, ‘-u/su.’ Finally, the limitation to the speaker and hearer rendered the speech style to be rarely used in spoken language these days. This study aims on verifying the sequence, correlation and causes of the various changes to {-o} by focusing on the spoken corpus of the twentieth century.The function of {-o} as a general honorific changed as the aristocracy (the Yangban class) started using the ‘hao’ style mutually. Later, the {-o} functioned as a style through which the speaker casually honors the hearer while not lowering himself/herself. As a result, {-o} lost its original function and became an ending which is difficult to used between a speaker and a hearer who is in a higher position than the speaker. Such usage spread even after the abolition of the status system, as the ‘hao’ style was used mutually between people in a social relationship without any acquaintance, and between strangers. The original usage, however, persevered among women and children who lived only within the local communities.As the honorific level of the ‘hao’ style had been lowered in formal context, vowel rising of the style was not readily accepted. Women and children who were not exposed to formal context and used the ‘hao’ style as a general honorific, however, readily accepted the phonological changes and used it as the ‘-u/su’ form. As a result, the function of ‘-o/so’ and ‘-u/su’ became different.The {-o}, which initially had no limitations to speakers or hearers, became an expression exclusively used by middle-aged or older speakers after the first half of the twentieth century. The spread of ‘hae’ and ‘haeyo’ created a limit to the speakers and hearers, leading to a drop in the usage of ‘hao’ and therefore, ‘hao’ became an ending which is almost never used in colloquial conversations.
홍종선	In this paper, the utterance final forms in spoken Korean of the first half of the 20th century are investigated and, comparing to the results of studies on sentence ending forms which were reported based on written Korean from the identical era, the characteristics of the utterance final forms of the spoken Korean in the first half of the 20th century. To achieve this, from ‘Spoken Korean Corpus by Korea University: The first half of the 20th Century’, different types of final forms have been distinguished based on conversational materials from movies as well as plays and movies made with gramophone. In particular, utterances with sentence endings are obtained and the frequency of each sentence ending’s use has been presented. The sentence endings of the spoken Korean in the first half of the 20th century show a slight difference from those of the written Korean of the same era. Formal endings have been simplified while informal endings have been actively used. Also, the endings that have been reported to appear in written Korean after 1945 were discovered in the spoken Korean during the particular time period, and the endings described in the spoken Korean data among the written Korean materials can be found in materials of the actual spoken language. Moreover, the final forms of the period often became generally-used endings. In variations of vowel harmony, there are more endings started in negative vowels than in positive vowels, so there can be noticed cases in which the stem of the preceding vowel is /ㅏ/ or the ending started with a negative vowel is even merged with a stem vowel such as /ㅡ/, which, in the ancient times, was /ㆍ/. Though different studies on sentence endings forms based on written language materials have mentioned on topics including post-modern Korean language and sentence ending forms during the time of enlightenment in 19th century, none of them has ever quantitatively explained the types and the frequency of their usage. This research is meaningful in quantitatively studying the types of each utterance final form and the frequency of use of its morpheme through which the concrete, detailed reality of the usage is able to be examined.
홍종선	This thesis analyze the morphological, distributional and functional characteristics of the 'an' type negative sentences in the first part of the twentieth century, based on the spoken language data. The data shows that morphologically, the old form 'ani' was noticeably less frequently realized, compared its usage in the written language data of the era. Moreover, 'ani' is less frequently used in the long-form negation than in the short-form negation. When 'ani' is used in sentences with the long-form negation, it is not followed by interrogative endings and 'ani' in sentences with the long-form negation are less frequently used in adjectival verbs than in action verbs. In terms of distribution, this study concludes that short-form negations are rarely used in adjectival verbs in comparison to action verbs and that root-separation of the negative adverb is seldom found in spoken language, when compared to written data. This study further shows that the confirmative function of the negative presupposition is realized more frequently through the long-form negation.
홍종선	This study aims to establish extent of research material for studies of spoken korean in the early 20th century. For this study, we critically examine preceding research which deals with spoken/written korean. This paper is to present how a written text can be used for spoken research. We could use written text as a cartoons in a newspaper, conference transcripts for the study of spoken korean in the early 20th century since spoken language data are quite limited and a cartoons in a newspaper, conference transcripts have spoken language properties like abbreviation and ellipsis, several endings, interrogative and negative expressions etc. In the future, we need to compare and analyze language phenomena in the written text and spoken language data.
홍종선	This study is aimed at determining the value and practical method as preliminary materials for the research of spoken language in its initial form of modern Korean language, exploring the type and characteristics of phonetic material at the beginning of the 20th century. To do this, this study examined the status of phonetic data at the start of the 20 century, which has been introduced or passed on up to now, discovered distinct features found in each type of data by dividing types into the contents of data and the methods of preservation, and had discussion on the possible application of spoken research. Phonetic material in early 20th century included not only materials such as story-telling, speech, lecture, play and movie recorded on gramophone but also film material of which Korean Federation of Film Archives restored films and kept. From the prospective of Korean linguistics, spoken language is divided into 'one-way', 'two-way' and 'informal', 'formal' according to the role of participants (tenor) and divided into 'professional' and 'normal' depending on what people say, or field: It is classified into 8 groups. Among them, in early 20th century, there was only phonetic data on 'professional and formal one-way', 'normal and formal one-way', 'normal and informal one-way', 'normal and informal two-way'. Meanwhile, depending on the method of data preservation, it is divided into phonetic material, phonetic and image material, and material written in the form of characters that was transcribed by later generations. While gramophone record is a device for conveying sound, movie film data shows sound and voice. Among gramophone record, there is a recorded data in which voice was recorded and transcribed. Phonetic material is highly valuable because it indicates the vivid aspects of daily use of language, compared with written material that is far from showing how people actually use their language. In order to carry out research for changes in spoken language and the process of the spread, it is necessarily needed to systematically prepare and classify phonetic material starting from the period of the beginning of phonetic recording.
홍종선	The aim of this paper is to research phonological and morphological features in Korean Voices from Berlin. The Korean Voices from Berlin was recorded in 1917 at Berlin by 5 Korean prisoners engaged in World War I, some of them came from North Hamgyeong Province, the others came from Pyeongan Province, therefore these data show a North Korean regional dialect. The data are composed of three materials, counting numbers, reciting scriptures and singing folksongs. The results of this research are as follows.1) The consonant system of Korean voices is similar to standard Korean. The 19 consonants are classified according to 5 manners of articulations and 5 points of articulations.2) The liquid /l/ has three allophones, [ɾ] appeared in an onset position, [l] in a word medial coda position or preceded by [l], [ɹ] in a word final coda position.3) The vowel system of Korean voices is similar to early 20th Korean’s. It has 8 monophthongs, /a, ʌ, o, u, ɯ, i, e, ɛ/.4) The 1 to 10 numbers in Korean voices are similar to Middle-Korean numerals.5) The genitive particle ‘/ɯi/의’ is pronounced [i], [ɯ], [ɛ], especially [ɯ] is appeared in Sino Korean.6) The /l/-deletion of conjugations are similar to Middle-Korean, /l/ deletion always occurred, if [+cor] consonants are followed.
홍종선	Over 70 years since Independence, the outer edge of the Korean Linguistics has been expanded in various ways with the development of the Korean Linguistics. When we roughly divide the study which is included in the external areas of the Korean Linguistics into interdisciplinary research and applied research, there are philosophy of language, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, rhetorics, Korean stylistics, glottochronology, mathematical linguistics, computational Korean lingustics, Korean corpus lingustics and Korean language culture studies in interdisciplinary research. In applied research, there are Korean educational linguistics, Korean educational linguistics as a foreign language, Korean lexicography, Computational Korean Linguistics, Korean lalopathology, Korean language policy, Korean medium lingustics, Korean advertising lingustics, interpretation studies and translation studies.These external studies of Korean Linguistics and pure Korean Linguistics help each other to expand their views and research methodology, adding various viewpoints in many ways, and achieving mutual rising development by providing new facts and materials in the aspect of information. It can also contribute to the development of Korean language culture by adding practicality that can be used in real life through external studies.Among interdisciplinary researches and applied researches, there are a lot of fields where the researches are already activated but there are still quite a few areas which are about to be studied. In the future, Korean linguistics research should foster user-oriented grammar with researcher-oriented grammar and greatly develop the study of spoken language and discourse. Therefore, we should enlarge the cooperating researches providing more information to external areas of Korean linguistics.
홍종선	This paper looked back at the fruits of Korean linguistics study in the past 70 years, and looked ahead for the future of Korean linguistics in a reunification-era. Although North and South Korea are currently separated with no language or academic communication, both sides of Korean linguistic studies have achieved results of great broadness and depth with their own linguistic concepts and theories. Those were the results of Korean linguists after the modern-transition period, who held fast to their national consciousness and never stopped pursuing high standard research.Korean linguistics initially centered around the discussion of part of speech. Later, Under the influence of constructional grammar, linguists shifted their focus to morphology with topics on morphological analysis, endings and suffixes and so on. When Generative grammar was introduced, the center of study shifted to syntax, and varies grammar categories were researched as a whole. Meanwhile, new theories were also applied in the area of phonology, and Korean linguistics have also expanded into semantics and pragmatics. Recently, new trends of western linguistics, such as cognitive linguistics, text linguistics, and functional linguistics, began to find their way into mainstream Korean linguistics study, which launched research on discourse grammar.In the past 70 years, Korean linguistic researches actively embraced western theories and achieved fruitful results. It is now time to develop linguistics theories specifically for Korean basing on its own unique characteristics. Also, at the dawn of reunification, it is also expected that there are more and more joint studies of North and South linguistics that map out a future for the Korean language.
홍종선	The purpose of this study is to analyze the prosodic features of the discourse marker "eodi (어디)." Using speech data collected from 10 (F5, M5) participants, prosodic features. such as tonal pattern, duration, and utterance rate of "어디", were analyzed based on their functions. The discourse marker "어디" is located at the beginning, middle, and end of the utterance, and can be presented as a single utterance. The specific tonal pattern of the discourse marker "어디" in each function can be noted at IP boundary tone, which is realized on the IP-final syllable "di (디)": H+L% (utterance initiation), L+L% (maintenance of utterance), L+H% (positive attitude, only in single utterance), L+HL% (negative attitude), and L+LH% (emphasizing). The average length of the discourse marker "어디" was the longest in the function of maintaining utterance (454 ms) and the shortest in positive attitude (267 ms). The study results also show that speakers modulate the speech rate of the discourse marker "어디" in their own utterance by lengthening or shortening the duration of each syllable.
홍종선	The purpose of this study is to investigate the function of the interrogative word '어디(where)' used as a discourse marker in spoken language. There are previous studies which discussed the semantic function of the discourse marker '어디(where)'. They, however, failed to clarify the contextual meaning of the sentence and the meaning of the discourse marker itself. we examined previous research and pointed out that their approach to classifying the function of discourse marker '어디(where)‘ is partially wrong. In this paper, we set two categories for classifying the discourse marker '어디(where)'; the textual mode and the interpersonal mode. There are five functions as a sub-category; one set of functions(initiating discourse, sustaining discourse) belongs to the former and another set of functions(positive attitude, the negative attitude, emphasizing) belongs to the latter. This approach is expected to provide much implication for studying the semantic function of discourse markers in future studies. In addition, we examined the usage and distribution of the discourse marker '어디‘ in two other spoken corpus and obtained different result depending on the data. This finding suggests that large, balanced, spoken corpus should be constructed for related research.
홍종선	Over a century of research on Korean linguistics using modern methodologies has led to some genuine and highly evaluated findings. Korean linguistics has advanced considerably by widening the extension of interdisciplinary and applied Korean linguistics etc., as well as pure theoretical research embracing foreign linguistic theories. To further expand this research, it is necessary to deepen the theoretical study of Korean linguistics. In addition, it is necessary to develop atheoretical framework of Korean grammar that can properly explain the distinct grammatical phenomena of the Korean language.Recently, Korean linguistics has attempted to seek new approaches. Grammatical research is increasing, with a focus on spoken rather than written language, and an emphasis on analysis of discourse rather than sentential units. This trend should become widespread. Until now, written language has been focused on more in research and even treated as more important than spoken language in the Korean corpus, writings about Korean grammar, textbooks of Korean education, definitions in Korean dictionaries. However, for inquiries into linguistic reality, it is necessary to focus more on spoken than on written language. In addition, a grammatical frame work that is oriented toward the awareness of language users must be developed.
홍종선	In the field of linguistics, although the spoken language plays as much crucial role as the written language in everyday language use, it has been neglected immensely over the years. It is, therefore, rather a relief to see the recent appearance of viable researches in Korean lin- guistics and Korean pedagogy based on the establishment of the corpus of spoken language. However, there are relentless conflicting views and per- spectives in academic circles whether the Korean spoken grammar pos- sesses a complete independent language system or it should not at all be distinguished from written grammar.In the late 19th century publications, only limited materials on spoken language of early modern Korean are found while a certain number of recorded voice materials are available in the 1920s. However, there is a great future ahead for the spoken language research as an extensive number of recorded voice materials exist from the national liberation period to the post-1960s, and due to some research institutions are now developing and incorporating some large scale voice corpora and spoken language corpora.As much as the study of written language, the grammatical study of spoken language must focus more on the everyday colloquial expressions of language populace. The user-centered grammatical study which investi- gates the actual use of colloquial expressions is as important as the re- searcher-centered grammatical study which inquires into theoretical aspects of languages. For example, although including ‘Haseyo style' in the hearer honorific levels may be perceived to be improper in the theoretical lin- guistic viewpoint, the claim can be accepted as an appropriate analysis reflecting the awareness of native language populace using ‘Haseyo style' widely in order to express the speaker's high regard toward the hearer.
홍종선	Even though Korean relative honorific expressions have gone through a lot in terms of systemic change in real life, the relative honorific speech level has followed the system which set up by Korean linguistics in the early of 20th century as before without any modification. Korean relative honorific system and construction should be based on the theory of Korean linguistics with consideration of Korean Speaker’s realization and awareness. Moreover the research of Korean relative honorific system for Korean education has to seek the explanatory to Korean normal speakers and provide comprehensible contents to Korean language learners of as the first and second language.This paper suggests that the relative honorific speech level is realized in mono system as a basic relative honorific system. This is from the idea that it is not realistic that there is four kinds of classes of formal style and two kinds of classes of informal style in dual system of the relative honorific speech level. The formality of utterance commonly depends on tone and involves the intervention elements of utterance manner. Hence, the dual system of the relative honorific speech level is not meaningful. This paper tries to set up the relative honorific speech level from ‘Hashipsio, Haseyo, Heyyo, Hey, and Heyla style’ according the degree of honorification and presents the retrospectives form of them by each. This is through reformulating the former researches and taking the frequency of use in real life. To educate Korean as the first and second language, this paper also suggest that ‘Hao-style’ and ‘Hagye-style’ are excluded from the basic system but handled in enrichment program.
홍종선	When the transition period to modern era in Korea arrived, some enlightened modern intellectuals were aware of and argued the importance of Korean instead of traditional Chinese. However, because of personal limits that they were more familiar with Chinese than Korean and in an atmosphere of knowledge society venerating Chinese, they mainly published an article in Korean-Chinese mixed body, not in net posts Hankeul. Their articles were written in diverse forms such as 'Gukhanmunche(Korean-Chinese mixed body) containing Chinese classics phrases', 'Gukhanmunche containing Chinese classics words' and 'Gukhanmunche containing Chinese characters words'. They had to pass the process of convincing, overcoming themselves and persuading modern intellectual readers in order to develop initial writing style with Gukhanmunche including Chinese classics phrases or words into Gukhanmunche including only Chinese characters words.In middle era <Korean> version of Chinese classics Buddhist scriptures, 'Gukhanmunche containing Chinese characters words' were mainly used.Though Chinese characters and Hankeul were both used, natural Korean expressions were possible. Ancient Novels in modern era were written in net posts Hankeul, especially Pansori Novels had colloquial style of texts.Therefore Gukhanmunche in modern transition period was only a wide application of traditional Gukhanmunche not a creation of new body.Pansori Novels are rather better than Lee Injik’ “Hyeol-eui-ru” or Lee Kwangsu’ “Mujeong” in that they used daily language in their texts more naturally. '-da' and '-at da' cannot be the mark of colloquial style. We have to get access in a variety of ways when we introduce colloquial expressions involving sentence endings into written language in order to increase matching degrees of colloquial language and written language in Korean.
홍종선	To step in the 20th century, Modern Korean has undergone successive sudden changes and ordeals from beginning of the 20th century to nowadays. Especially in the second half of the 20th century, there are not little differences in one Korean language; the South and North Korean caused by making each to go separate way under two different ideologies and political systems. It is the time to find out a solution to develop Korean as a racial language not to damage homogeneity of Korean language anymore.After the division of Korea, the South and North have had several academic exchanges. However the result of academic exchange was unsatisfied and not lasted longer. Not in good atmosphere, it is fortunate that South and North Korea scholars is compiling Gyeoremal Keunsajeon(겨레말큰사전), and no doubt that compiling it is important business to build the national unity and work hard the development of Korean. The business to recover and develop the homogeneity of racial language has to place in priority. Unification of language and culture will contribute to understand each language and culture and gain emotional exchange.The division of Korea resulted in a big and diverse gap between the South and North Korea language and it is a matter of regret. From another perspective, it can be a abundant property in Korean racial language after the different language substance will be unified. Language unification will realize when it is unified with understanding and love in mutual cooperation over the time, not in a short time.
홍종선	Use of Loan words in Broadcasting Language and its Improvement - Centered on Weekend TV Drama Analysis - Jo, Min-haÂ·Hong, Jong-seon The purpose of this paper was to propose reasonable improvement measures by investigating current use of loan words and foreign language in broadcasting. For that, we conducted discussion after examining current use of both loan words and foreign language in 18 dramas that had been put on the airwaves by 3 terrestrial channels and 4 cable TV channels over the last 5 months.For loan words, we suggested that refined words, if any, should be used based on naturalness on one hand and revised or complemented on the other hand. For foreign language, we proposed alternative indigenous Korean expressions if there were any available Korean words that could replace foreign words, phrases, and sentences naturally. For expressions used to describe new objects in loan words and foreign language, expressions that reflected sociocultural phenomenon, and idiomatic expressions that could be shared with the public, we presented a method for excluding such expressions from restriction or lowering the management threshold.
홍종선	Korean honorific system is a grammatical category with relatively large changes even in the modern Korean after 20th century. There are a lot of contents, which are not appropriate to today’s linguistic reality in hearer honorific system that is set by current school grammar. Establishing two-dimensional speech levels as 4 grades of formal body and 2 grades of informal body is less realistic. It reveals evidently in Sejong balanced corpus and dialogue of television drama. Excluding ‘Hao’ style and ‘Hagae’ style in speech levels because they are almost disappearing, it is necessary to set ‘up Haseyo’ style which is frequently used. Also two-dimensional system is also unrealistic. Therefore it becomes one-dimensional system of ‘Hasypsio, Haseyo, Haeyo, Hae, Haera’.Educational grammar should aim user-oriented grammar further than theoretical grammar. It is realistic to establish one-dimensional 5 grades of speech levels above in elementary of intermediate level national language grammar for natives or Korean grammar for foreign Korean learners. In just a high-level national language grammar or Korean grammar it can be able to deal ‘Hao’ style and ‘Hagae’ style. It is natural that ‘Hagae’ style and ‘Hao’ style are not included in model dialogue of Korean education textbook that each institutions use currently.Like this, user-oriented grammar has an effective grammar system and contents for users not only in Korean language education but also in many Korean Applied linguistics.
홍종선	In the transition period to modern era, a new awareness on the character life appeared in Korea centrally from enlightened intellectuals. It was to write our language in Gukhanmunche(Korean -Chinese mixed body) or Hankeul body instead of traditionally used Chinese. However there was a limit in their recognition of Korean and realization because they were also nobility who were more familiar with Chinese.Yu Giljun(유길준) who claimed and practiced gukhanmunche in the front used it in 「Seoyugyeonmun」(「서유견문」) including a lot of Chinese. Yu Giljun's Gukhanmunche writings are far from colloquial style and also it is hard to say that his writings are written in Korean. Yet it is estimated as accomplished changes of syntax structure from Chinese to Korean. Yu Giljun's Gukhanmun mixed body were for nobilities who were based in Chinese, but it also derived from personal limitation that he was not familiar with Korean writing style because he was used to write in Chinese rather than Korean. At that time, most of the enlightened intellectuals chose Gukhanmunche including Chinese phrases or words. Even among them there were personnels who achieved self-reformation by changing Gukhanmunche including Chinese phrases or words into Gukhanmunche including Korean Chinese words or Hankeul body, Yu Giljun never had this recognition or practice experience.
홍종선	Since more and more exchanges between China and South Korea, Therefore Chinese people of learning Korean are more and more. Depending on the level of students, the learning content is also different in Korean. The higher the level of students, language proficiency requirements for higher. Therefore, for in the future, we can find a more specific and effective education plan for china learners during the education of Korean attribute pregnant sentence, this study examined the error during the process of learning Korean attribute pregnant sentences through the experiment survey of Chinese students and found the cause of the error.First, because students from primary to come into contact Korean attribute pregnant sentence suffix, so according to the survey results, when only involves attribute pregnant sentence suffix, got good results. But when involves the relationship between the child and the parent text message, got bad results. Second, the chinese students very inadequate understanding of the kinds of Korean attribute pregnant sentences. Students can not clearly distinguish between these three types. Third, due to the different types and structures between Chinese an Korean attribute pregnant sentence, the students can not accurately use this syntax to make sentence. At the same time, we look forward to future research on education programs.
홍종선	This study selected korean attribute pregnant sentences as research goals. Through experiments investigation to find errors when china learners study korean attribute pregnant sentences. Then analyzed the causes of these errors occur. Through these, finally, using the correspondence of korean and chinese attribute pregnant sentences, provided a more specific and effective education programs for chinese learners.First, for primary learners, due to lack of basic knowledge of korean, so in the teaching process will need to form korean attribute suffix as the focus. Second, intermediate learners already have some knowledge of Korean, so you can pay attention to the using of sentences while learning korean attribute suffix to improve the learners’ discovery capability.
홍종선	In sentential types in Korean, the ‘exclamatory sentence’ is under some controversy among scholars with respect to whether it can be classified as an independent sentential type. However, since the exclamatory sentence has its own characteristics distinguished from the declarative sentence, it can be established as a sentential type in Korean. Although the criteria for categorial division and classification of type for the exclamative sentence are not clearly defined, these facts cannot be the reasons to claim that the exclamative sentence is not an independent sentential type. In fact, Korean exclamatory sentence has not been highlighted much in previous researches.The exclamatory sentence in spoken Korean is rarely constructed with the sentential endings classified to this date as exclamatory endings. Following the author’s analysis of exclamatory sentences used in the dialogue of television dramas, it is revealed that the exclamatory sentence often ends with various final endings and connective endings as well as other parts of speech. For this matter, the main factor governing the hearers’ recognition of the exclamatory sentence mainly depends on intonation.The exclamatory sentence in spoken Korean does not only have the tone of /231/ and /241/ unlike what is claimed in other previous grammar books.In fact, the final intonation of actual utterance is realized with all of three types such as ‘flat tone’, ‘rising tone’, and ‘falling tone’. Compared to the declarative sentence, the exclamatory sentence is more dynamic in articulation since it has a greater fluctuation of intonation in utterance. Furthermore, the exclamatory sentence has a higher sound pitch in the final syllable of an utterance and whole utterance compared to the declarative sentence, and also the final syllable of an utterance has a longer sound length in the exclamatory sentence.
홍종선	Being an agglutinative language, Korean is abundant with postpositions and endings. Consequently, eojeol dictionary， which fully reflects this morphological feature, could be a much more useful form of dictionary comparing to traditional ones. In the field of Korean acquisition or computerization, this from of dictionary is especially important and necessary. In order to compile a Korean eojeol dictionary, its headwords should be the first under discussion. This paper looks into the characteristics, scale, morphology and arrangement of headwords of Korean enjeol dictionary.In an enjeol dictionary, the unit of headword is enjeol. This means that a combination of a noun and postpositions, or a combination of a verb/adjective and endings should both be dictionary entries. Thus all inflection forms of the same word, as well as traditional Korean dictionary entries such as word, postposition, ending, and idiomatic phrase are all eligible headwords. More over, to fully consider the user-need, when the pronunciation of a headword is different from its morphological form, this phonological form(one morph of the morpheme)should also be a headword. As another attempt to enhance practicality, informal orthographies and pronunciations which are widely used should also be listed as headwords.Pronunciation headwords, headwords that are Listed because they read different from their basic morphological forms, will be written in a bracket in order to be separated form their basic forms. Eojeols that share the same form or pronunciation are arranged by superscript according to their frequency. The number of headwords can be decided according to the dictionary scale. Generally, eojeols of a frequency of 2-3, or more, in a large-scale balanced corpus could be collected as headwords. Sub-entries are meaningless, all headwords are main entries in an eojeol dictionary. Finally, as for the idiomatic phrases , traditional compiling method can be applied as it is.
홍종선	The suitable dictionary to Korean, an agglutinative language is ‘Eojeol(어절) dictionary’. It is very difficult to figure out the basic one easily from the combined form Eojeol of noun or verb for nonnative Korean learners, and so with computer programming. The solution of these matters is the Eojeol dictionary compilation.In this paper several problems about micro structure to compile the Eojeol dictionary are investigated. Grammatical information will be elaborated in stages by hypersexual method. Definition statements of an entry are divided into two methods; one is in basic entry and the other in sub-entry. The former will be clarified meanings similar to previous word dictionary and latter will be described just with form analysis. The meanings or functions of individual analyzed form in latter are depended on those of basic entry. Examples are designed to reflect actual language enough and to be able to refer the comparative expressions.
홍종선	Like in other dictionaries, definition is the most important component in Korean Learners’ Dictionary. Definition offered in Korean Learners’ Dictionary should be the both accurate and easy to understand. In order to achieve this goal, this paper examined the principles for definitions in Korean Learners’ Dictionary, as well as actual realization of the principles.While following most of the principles for definition in general dictionaries, it is also necessary to establish principle for a learners’ dictionaries. Like in general dictionaries, definition should be straightforward, use simple expressions, avoid synonyms and circularity, and also be balanced between words in the same category. Considering the special characteristics of learners’ dictionary, definition should also fulfill the following principles. Namely, respect everyday usage, include social and cultural information, use simple and specific expressions, provide real life usage information, and list definitions of polysemy in the order of frequence.Although previous Korean Learners’ Dictionaries did more or less take the principles listed into consideration, there are doubtlessly space for improvement. It is urgent to cooperate research progress of lexicography and Korean language education to achieve a better Korean Learners’ Dictionary.
홍종선	The early 20th century is a period of time when Korea confronted with the surging waves of modernization, and made a variety of internal reactions. The Korean language, not immune to the upheaval, also experienced new changes and gradually gained characteristics of today’s Korean. Although scholars have not yet fully agreed upon the time division of Korean, Gabo reformation (1896) is usually considered to be the beginning of modern Korean. Thus, the early 20th century was also the beginning of modern Korean.Phonological, lexical, and grammatical characteristics of modern day Korean began to appear during this period of time. Phonologically, the 10 vowel system was established, glottal sounds and aspirated sounds increased, vowel harmony declined. Phenomena such as vowel raising, front-vowelization，monophthongization, and the word-initial rule appeared. Meanwhile, hangul-Chinese mix writing became common practice, and hangul-only writing also started to take place in narrative writing, and elements of spoken language began to reflect in written language. All those pointed to the unification of written and spoken language. Under the influence of modernization, a great amount of new words appeared. Especially, Japanese and other foreign words flooded in in great quantities.Grammatically, ‘-eos-（-엇-）, -neun-(-는-), -ges-(-겟-)’ trichotomy system of tenses was established, and hearer-oriented honorific system also formed a binary system of ‘hasoseo(하소서), hasibsio(하십시오), hao(하오), hage(하게), haera(해라)’ and ‘hae(해), haeyo(해요)’. In word formation and sentence construction, the use of ‘-gi(-기)’ became more frequent than ‘-eum(-음)’, while ‘∼geot(∼ 것)’ also significantly increased. In negative, causative and passive expressions, the use of long form, which has fewer restrictions than the short form, became more frequent. A tendency towards simplicity appeared. In the same vain, long and complex sentences with several clauses tend to be avoided. Instead, short simple sentences became more favorable.Korean linguistics scholars should pay closer attention to the modernization period, which includes the early 20th century. In order to fully understand today’s Korean language, more thorough research on this immediately preceding period is necessary.
홍종선	Modern Korean began to make its way to the front stage at the beginningof the 20th century. During which time, Korean language has undergonesignificant changes in various aspects. Under the increasing influence ofwestern culture and ideology, a new understanding towards nationallanguage, the Unification of the Spoken and Written Language, began toemerge while ethnic consciousness awakened. The Unification of theSpoken and Written Language means to write with hangul instead of Chinesecharacters and to write in spoken terms instead of written terms.In this unification movement, many major attempts were made in novelwriting, among which, several sinsoseol pieces by Lee Injik achieved acertain level of success, and Lee Kwangsu's masterpiece “Mujeong”brought the movement further ahead.However, it is hard to say that the development appeared in novels is theresult of peoples' linguistic insights or their understanding towards spokenlanguage. Instead, it is more of a convenient borrowing of the spoken termsfrom pansori genre novels. Pansori novels started from modern Koreanperiod and enjoyed a long-lasting popularity among common Koreans. Beingthe intellectuals of the new era, sinsoseol writers took advantage of thepopularity of the pansori novels and brought the spoken forms into their owncreative works. Hence, they were able to point out a new direction towards writing in Korean. As a result, Novels in that period used expressions closerto spoken language than other genres did.It is not correct to consider the shift from ‘-deora’(-더라) to ‘-da’(-다)or‘-eossda’(-었다) as a significant development in the unification of spokenand written language. In order to judge orality, a comprehensiveinvestigation of phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicology and discourseis necessary.

정우봉	"In this paper, I explored and showcased the author and work of new Korean record, Bukjeongdongyurok. This work is a new record unknown to the academic world. Bukjeongdongyurok recorded the experiences of Lee Se-taek's trip to Hamgyeong province and Mt. Geumgang in 1761. He was appointed to the office of Bupyeongsa, and he worked in Hamgyeong Province.This work has a work structure in which the part of performing public service and the sight-seeing spot are interlaced. The first part of the work, ‘北征錄’, stands out as an official who performs public service, while the second part of the work, ‘東遊錄’ stands out as a tourist who visits the famous natural landscape. The work is structured in a combination of the two. The main characteristics of the works were divided into interesting and realistic descriptions of natural landscapes, widespread use of interesting narratives and tales, interest in Choson royal ruins, and public service as officials.	"
홍종선	"In this study, the linguistic features of spoken and written expressions of South and North Korean were examined through the analysis of quasi-spoken language corpora. The Korean language can be understood better through a broader study of spoken language than written language. In this paper, the frequencies of the use of parts of speech, transformative endings, the forms of ending sentences/utterances, types of sentences/utterances, degree adverbs used as the meaning ‘very’ were researched. The language expressions of South and North Korean have a lot in common, but there are not a few differences in part.The differences appear more in colloquialism than in written language. The exact understanding of them will be possible by building a very large scale of spoken and written corpus of South and North Korean.	"
강헌국	"Yeom Sang-sup who practiced realism with reproduction and editorial, contains a new method into his creative writing methodology around the time his second visit to Japan. It is a reasoning technique. The editorials developed by characters or the narrator used to be futile in the work. In comparison, reproduction of actions and events gained a concrete sense of reality. As a result, reproduction overwhelmed the thesis. Such an imbalance has led to the plight of Yeom Sang-sup, which makes it difficult to implement the intended subject. It would not have been acceptable for him to go so far as to have his intrinsic value become comic.In Yeom Sang-sup's novel, the reasoning technique is introduced to adjust the imbalance between reproduction and editorial. The reasoning has logical and empirical properties. The two attributes allow the reasoning to sit between reproduction and editorial. As the logical attribute reaches the editorial and the empirical attribute reaches the reproduction, reasoning interlocks the editorial and the reproduction.With the introduction of the reasoning technique, there is room for a person who has only argued as an editorial to take action. The intrinsic values of the words are practiced and the imbalance between editorials and reproduction is adjusted. As the reasoning technique sets the characters in a relative relationship between detective and criminal, there is a confrontation between the good characters and the evil characters in Salang Gwha Joe. In three showdowns, the good group beats the evil group, but the victory is still tentative. As long as evil groups host colonial power, good ones cannot win. Salang Gwha Joe ends in a sudden collapse of a good group. Yi Sim unfold the world after the disappearance of the good group. The people left in that world is in a more fierce struggle than in Salang Gwha Jae to realize their own desires and interests. The conspiracies and deceit that they commit among themselves are effectively embodied in the work through the reasoning technique. The greed and evil struggles of the characters are themselves the current state of the corrupt world. Even the act of selling one's wife to a brothel is claimed to be justice in that world.	"
장경준	"The Urimalsaem contains the historical information of about 5,000 lexical items. They are based on the materials as a part of the 21st Century Sejong Project, which has constructed from 2002.The historical information in the Urimalsaem, however, have several issues. The information is provided only in modern entries and is especially careless about semantic changes. In giving examples, the modern and archaic entries are asymmetric and one can find hardly semantic differences from the examples. The information about related words is not well-constructed and there are not a few cases that the historical information is not described well due to the exclusion of Old Korean materials from the reference.In order to resolve these issues, it is necessary to collect the corpora of historical materials maximally and to fine them for high-quality data. Also the corpora of historical materials need to be open so that users of the Urimalsaem can search and correct errors from them, correct and supplement the historical informations of lexical items furthermore.

신지영	"This paper aims at proposing issues of breath and memory in speech based on the quantitative analysis of breath groups and pause units in Korean. As a human being, we have two kinds of limitations on continuing speech; breath and memory. The prosodic structure and temporal structure of spontaneous speech data from six speakers were closely examined. One of the main findings of the present study is that the prosodic structure and temporal structure of Korean appears to reflect the breath and memory problems in speech.	"
정우봉	"Haehaenggi(海行記) is the only personal recording of Munwihaeng(問慰行), namely trip for foreign affairs for condolence. Munwihaeng was a delegation for foreign affairs which was continued more than 260 years from 1620 till 1860 between Choson and Japan.It is not known about the author of Haehaenggi. I said about who is the author of Haehaenggi through the relevant data. As a result, the author of Haehaenggi was Kim Hong-jo(金弘祖). Kim Hong-jo was from Woobong Kim's family produce foreign language interpreters for hundreds of years. He inherited the family tradition that performed practice of diplomatic activity and writing.He had superior to others in Japanese culture. But he had relatively objective viewpoint about Japanese culture. In particular, he did actively keep company with Japanese intellectuals. The representative character is Usambangju(雨森芳洲). Also he had active interest in No(能), namely one of the traditional Japanese plays. He had active and friendly attitude on the Japanese traditional performance scene.	"
정우봉	"This thesis was focused on explaining the characteristics on the records of traveling in Peking(燕行錄, Yeonhaengrok) written by Hong Yangho(洪 良浩). I was concerned about China image which Hong Yangho made attept to innovate in the records of traveling in Peking. Hong Yangho’s China image in Yeonhaengrok is very important. And I introduced Hong Yangho’s new Yeonhaengrok text, namely Yeonwoonjabgi(燕遼雜記). This text was important because of showing Hong Yangho’s Northern Learning (北學思想).I believe that analyzing wrting style and characteristics in Hong Yangho’s Yeonhaengrok can contribute to understanding the literature history of Yeonhaengrok in the late Chosun dynasty. Also, I expect that this kind of approaching could play a role in creating another methodology to analyze Yeonhaengrok.	"
김정숙	"The aim of this study is an analysis of conversation textbooks published in the beginning of the 20th century for Korean learners of Japanese in terms of content and presentation style. To this end, seven textbooks have been selected that focus on the conversation among the books published at that time. I researched how the criteria of the textbook units is arranged, the presentation of the dialogue, the way the authors mark the speakers of the dialogue, and whether or not they have translations and phonetic value of dialogue in Japanese. In addition, I researched the change of overall content and presentation style over time. In conclusion, the features of conversation textbooks for Korean learners of Japanese have changed over time. At first, most textbooks were organized by subjects and situations such as daily life, personal relationships and friendships, nature, jobs, and business. Next, the textbooks began to include practical dialogues relating to daily life, friendships, and jobs at the beginning, but the subjects they dealt with were shifted towards business contexts and abstract concepts. After the year 1910 when colonization over Korean was full-fledged, content for teachers and civil servants was fortified and policemen textbooks were published. Thirdly, sentences for practicing conversation were presented as dialogue or isolated sentences; mixed forms of sentences also appeared in the same units. When dialogues were used they cannot be completed in terms of meaning. Fourthly, even though their focuses are conversation, five textbooks do not have the title of the speakers. Five textbooks present sentences marked with numbers.One textbook presented sentences without any marks. Fifthly, all textbooks presented Korean sentences with a Japanese translation, and only one book includes phonetic value. Finally, Six textbooks have a vocabulary section that comprise of semantic parts with dialogue. Among them, five textbooks present vocabulary by subject, such as daily life, interpersonal and social relations and business related words. These words strongly reflected situations of those times.

김정숙	"The purpose of this study was to analyze the advanced Korean Language curricula at major language institutions in Korea and further compare the mastery level of the advanced curriculum with the rating system of the International Standard Curriculum of Korean Language. In order to do this, the general objectives and items of topics and functions within Levels 5 to 7 in the International Standard Curriculum, along with the objectives, topics and functions in advanced curricula in major Korean language institutes were analyzed. Followed by a comparative analysis of the objectives and educational contents in the advanced level curriculum of Korean language institutes with the International standard Curriculum of Korean Language, the level of mastery between objectives and educational contents were compared and analyzed. The objectives in Levels 5 to 6 in the International Standard Curriculum were expressing opinions regarding social and abstract topics, and understanding topics from professional fields unfamiliar to the learner in presentations, discussions and debate. The items of topics and functions were also provided accordingly. The objectives that were analyzed from the advanced level curriculum in Korean language institutes were set from Level 5 and 6 to Level 7 in the Standard Curriculum. Among the Level 6 objectives, ‘professional fields, academic topics, professional materials, university level tasks, and complex and professional tasks’ were included as significant portion and this is equivalent to Level 7 in the standard curriculum. The topics from the advanced level curriculum in Korean language institutes mainly included the topic items within the Standard Curriculum and were equivalent to its advanced level. However, there was an imbalance of topics in certain fields and the topics were not covered in depth; moreover, the differences between levels amongst topics in the advanced curriculum of each institute were evident. Regarding function, there was also an imbalance in items in the advanced level curriculum and a high frequency of functions from the basic or intermediate level; therefore, the functions in the advanced curriculum were lower than the suggested level in the International Standard Curriculum. The differences between the functional items compared with the educational objectives in each institute were also significant.	"
장경준	"Chosun dynasty has imported Daemyeongrul from Ming dynasty, translated it with Idu, and made Daemyeongrul-Jikhae which was publicated for the first time in 1395. In this paper, the original sentence and the translated sentence of Daemyeongrul-Jikhae were compared and classified into 7 different styles of translation. They are literal translation, liberal translation, adaptation, double translation, mistranslation, abridgment, omission. And 1/7 of the full text of Daemyeongrul-Jikhae was analyzed in detail to see which translation style shows up.The result of the analysis is as follows. First of all, the translator of Daemyeongrul paid great attention to the working level government officials who would practically apply Daemyeongrul in Chosun. And they had translated it by using Idu expressions to make it sound easier. Therefore, the korean officials who are not familiar with the wordings in Daemyeongrul could understand it better. Secondly, if the contents of Daemyeongrul was too far off from the actual circumstances of Chosun, they’ve made some changes so it could fit with the circumstances in Chosun or else, they’ve eliminated the contents at all. Lastly, the mistranslation or omission rate was very low.By this analysis, we can see that Daemyeongrul-Jikhae was a high quality translation where the professionals in Chosun had put in a lot of effort to establish the foundation of a constitutional state even during the chaotic age right after Chosun was established.

김정숙	"This study aims to establish the constructs of oral proficiency tests in Korean, which could contribute to development of a large-scale speaking test of Korean. Test tasks of this study are independent discourse production which is suited for semi-direct tests that maximize the practicality of the test while also examining the performance of test takers at an intermediate level. To achieve the goal, this study reviews theories and research related to the constructs of oral proficiency tests in Korean including theories based on communicative competence. This study also investigates and analyzes what kind of abilities an expert group of Korean language educators possess regarding constructs of oral proficiency by establishing their own beliefs about constructs of oral proficiency, then changing the constructs after listening to the utterances of test-takers. Based on this, it suggests seven abilities as constructs of oral proficiency in Korean: task ability, content ability, discourse ability, interaction ability, linguistic ability, sociolinguistic ability, pronunciation ability and delivery ability.

신지영	"The previous studies on semantics and syntax are mainly based on written language. As a result, semanticians and syntacticians do not seriously consider the prosodic aspects of language, which is not visible in written texts. However, as the prosodic aspects of language play an important role in spoken language, researchers who are interested in the spoken grammar, have to take account of the prosodic structure of the speech data. This paper aims to show how prosodic account can help to find some plausible answers to semantic and syntactic problems based on some empirical evidences by analysing the 46,529 entries of dictionary, spontaneous speech over 400,000 syllables, and 446 proverbs. The average number of intonational phrase is 7.2 syllables, which reflects working memory proposed by Miller(1994). Strikingly similar statistical results between spontaneous speech and proverbs are obtained. In addition, asymmetric use between short negation and long negation is observed by comparing the frequency of occurrence of negative sentence in casual dialogue, formal presentation, and a written report. Long negation tends to be more used in formal speech than in casual speech and more used in writing than in speaking. The reason why short negation is more used in speaking than in writing, appears to be related to the disambiguation of a negative sentence by prosody of speech.	"
장경준	"The purpose of this study is to examine woodblock prints possessed at Komazawa University and Hosa Library which are most precedent versions among a number of different versions of Daemyeongryul- Jikhae. This study has determined that both of two prints are same version printed by identical woodblock and the print of Hosa Library out of them was the fine version printed at an earlier stage. Moreover, this study has compared the print of Hosa Library with that of Mansong's collection of books in Korea University, thus the distinction has been classified into 4 types and described in detail. From the analysis about the difference between the prints of Hosa Library and Mansong's collection of books, this study has extrapolated the versions of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae in the early period of the Joseon Dynasty.This study suggests that the print of Daemyeongryul-Jikhae in Hosa Library demonstrates revision of legal articles and literal translation of the articles and thus, it is valuable literature that provides a basis for revising error in later versions including the print in Mansong's collection of books. Since various simplified forms and variants of Chinese characters were used in the print of Hosa Library, it is useful literature for studying Chinese character culture which was prevalent in local at the early period of the Joseon Dynasty.

신지영	"The aim of this study is to investigate the morphological and prosodic features of discourse marker {jom} related the functions using spoken language corpus(speech corpus). To achieve this, we distinguished [tɕom] and [tɕ*om] and analyzed prosodic features of {jom} such as position in utterance, prosodic boundary, duration, pause, tonal patterns. As a result, functions of {jom} have the following four categories: Politeness, Focus, Delay, Utterance mitigation. In morphological features according to the functions, [tɕom] is high frequency for Politeness and [tɕ*om] for Delay, Utterance mitigation. Also prosodic features of {jom} is peculiar to each function. Consequently morphological and prosodic features are important distinction for establishing function of {jom}.	"
